# 1. INTRODUCTION
**This is a pre-release draft of the S/MIME Baseline Requirements (SBR). This draft has not yet been balloted to become a CA/Browser Forum standard. Comments are welcomed.**

## 1.1 Overview

This S/MIME Baseline Requirements document describes an integrated set of technologies, protocols, identity-proofing, lifecycle management, and auditing requirements that are necessary for the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates.

An S/MIME Certificate for the purposes of this document can be identified by the existence of an Extended Key Usage (EKU) for `emailProtection` (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4) and the inclusion of a `rfc822Name` or an `otherName` of type `id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox` in the `subjectAltName` extension.

**Notice for Readers**

An S/MIME Certificate contains a public key bound to an email address and MAY also contain the identity of a natural person or legal entity that controls such email address. The key pair can then be used to sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt email. 

This Certificate Policy (CP) describes a subset of the requirements that a CA MUST meet in order to issue Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates. This document serves two purposes: to specify Baseline Requirements and to provide guidance and requirements for what a CA should include in its Certification Practice Statement (CPS). These Requirements apply only to relevant events that occur on or after DATE (the original effective date of these Requirements).

These Requirements do not address all of the issues relevant to the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates. To facilitate a comparison of other CP and/or CPS (e.g., for policy mapping), this document includes all sections of the [RFC 3647](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3647) framework. The CA/Browser Forum MAY update these Requirements from time to time.

These Requirements do not address the issuance or management of Certificates by enterprises that operate their own Public Key Infrastructure for internal purposes only, and for which the Root CA Certificate is not distributed by any Application Software Supplier. These Requirements are applicable to all Certification Authorities within a chain of trust. They are to be flowed down from the Root CA through successive Subordinate CAs.

## 1.2 Document name and identification

This Certificate Policy contains the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates, as adopted by the CA/Browser Forum.

The following Certificate Policy identifiers are reserved for use by CAs as a means of asserting compliance with this document (OID arc 2.23.140.1.5) as follows:

## 1.3 PKI participants

The CA/Browser Forum is a voluntary organization of Certification Authorities and Application Software Suppliers including providers of Internet browser and other relying-party software applications, such as mail user agents (web-based or application based) and email service providers that process S/MIME Certificates.

### 1.3.1 Certification authorities

Certification Authority (CA) is defined in [Section 1.6.1](#161-definitions). Current CA Members of the CA/Browser Forum are listed at https://cabforum.org/members.

### 1.3.2 Registration authorities

With the exception of [Section 3.2.2](#322-validation-of-mailbox-authorization-or-control), the CA MAY delegate the performance of all, or any part, of [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) requirements to a Delegated Third Party, provided that the process as a whole fulfills all of the requirements of [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation).

Before the CA authorizes a Delegated Third Party to perform a delegated function, the CA SHALL contractually require the Delegated Third Party to:

1. Meet the qualification requirements of [Section 5.3.1](#531-qualifications-experience-and-clearance-requirements), when applicable to the delegated function;
2. Retain documentation in accordance with [Section 5.5.2](#552-retention-period-for-archive);
3. Abide by the other provisions of these Requirements that are applicable to the delegated function; and
4. Comply with (a) the CA's CP and/or CPS or (b) the Delegated Third Party's practice statement that the CA has verified complies with these Requirements.

#### 1.3.2.1 Enterprise registration authorities

The CA MAY designate an Enterprise Registration Authority (RA) to verify Certificate Requests from the Enterprise RA's own organization. The CA SHALL NOT accept Certificate Requests authorized by an Enterprise RA unless the following requirements are satisfied:

1. If the Certificate Request is for an `Organization-validated` or `Sponsor-validated` profile, the CA SHALL confirm that the Enterprise RA has authorization or control of the requested email domains in accordance with [Section 3.2.2.1](#3221-validating-authority-over-mailbox-via-domain) or [Section 3.2.2.3](#3223-validating-applicant-as-operator-of-associated-mail-servers). The CA SHALL confirm that the `subject:organizationName` name is either that of the delegated enterprise, or an Affiliate of the delegated enterprise, or that the delegated enterprise is an agent of the named Subject. For example, the CA SHALL NOT issue a Certificate containing the Subject name "XYZ Co." on the authority of Enterprise RA "ABC Co.", unless the two companies are Affiliated as defined in [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) or "ABC Co." is the agent of "XYZ Co". This requirement applies regardless of whether the accompanying requested email domain falls within the subdomains of ABC Co.'s Registered Domain Name.

2. If the Certificate Request is for a `Mailbox-validated` profile, the CA SHALL confirm that the mailbox holder has control of the requested email domains in accordance with [Section 3.2.2.2](#3222-validating-control-over-mailbox-via-email).

The CA SHALL impose these limitations as a contractual requirement on the Enterprise RA and monitor compliance by the Enterprise RA in accordance with [Section 8.8](#88-review-of-enterprise-ra-or-technically-constrained-subordinate-ca).

### 1.3.3 Subscribers

As defined in [Section 1.6.1](#16-definitions-and-acronyms).

### 1.3.4 Relying parties

“Relying Party” and “Application Software Supplier” are defined in [Section 1.6.1](#16-definitions-and-acronyms). Current Members of the CA/Browser Forum who are Application Software Suppliers are listed at https://cabforum.org/members.

### 1.3.5 Other participants

Other groups that have participated in the development of these Requirements include the CPA Canada WebTrust for Certification Authorities task force and the Accredited Conformity Assessment Bodies’ Council (ACAB’C). Participation by these groups does not imply their endorsement, recommendation, or approval of the final product.

## 1.4 Certificate usage

The primary goal of these Requirements is to provide a framework of “reasonable assurance” to senders and recipients of email messages that the party identified in an S/MIME Certificate has control of the domain or email address being asserted. A variation of this use case is where an individual or organization digitally signs email to establish its authenticity and source of origin. 

### 1.4.1 Appropriate certificate uses

The primary goal of these Requirements is to describe an integrated set of technologies, protocols, identity-proofing, lifecycle management, and auditing requirements for the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates. These Requirements also serve to inform users and help them to make informed decisions when relying on Certificates.

### 1.4.2 Prohibited certificate uses

No stipulation.

## 1.5 Policy administration

This document MAY be revised from time to time, as appropriate, in accordance with procedures adopted by the CA/Browser Forum. The CA/Browser Forum welcomes recommendations and suggestions regarding this standard by email at <questions@cabforum.org>. 

### 1.5.1 Organization administering the document

No stipulation.

### 1.5.2 Contact person

Contact information for the CA/Browser Forum is available at https://cabforum.org/leadership/. In this section of a CA’s CPS, the CA SHALL provide a link to a web page or an email address for contacting the person or persons responsible for operation of the CA, including contact information for entities wishing to submit a Certificate Problem Report or revocation request.

### 1.5.3 Person determining CPS suitability for the policy

No stipulation.

### 1.5.4 CPS approval procedures

No stipulation.

###  1.6.4 Conventions

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in these Requirements shall be interpreted in accordance with [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

# 2. PUBLICATION AND REPOSITORY RESPONSIBILITIES
The CA SHALL develop, implement, enforce, and annually update a Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement (CP and/or CPS) that describes in detail how the CA implements the latest version of these Requirements.

## 2.1 Repositories

The CA SHALL make revocation information for Subordinate CA Certificates and Subscriber Certificates available in accordance with this Policy.

## 2.2 Publication of certification information

The CA SHALL publicly disclose its CP and/or CPS through an appropriate and readily accessible online means that is available on a 24x7 basis. The CA SHALL publicly disclose its CA business practices to the extent required by the CA's selected audit scheme (see [Section 8](#8-compliance-audit-and-other-assessments)).

The CP and/or CPS SHALL be structured in accordance with [RFC 3647](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3647) and SHALL include all material required by [RFC 3647](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3647).

The CA SHALL publicly give effect to these Requirements and represent that it will adhere to the latest published version. The CA MAY fulfill this requirement by incorporating these Requirements directly into its CP and/or CPSs or by incorporating them by reference using a clause such as the following (which SHALL include a link to the official version of these Requirements):

> [Name of CA] conforms to the current version of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates published at http://www.cabforum.org. In the event of any inconsistency between this document and those Requirements, those Requirements take precedence over this document.

## 2.3 Time or frequency of publication

The CA SHALL develop, implement, enforce, and annually update a CP and/or CPS that describes in detail how the CA implements the latest version of these Requirements. The CA SHALL indicate conformance with this requirement by incrementing the version number and adding a dated changelog entry, even if no other changes are made to the document.

## 2.4 Access controls on repositories

The CA SHALL make its Repository publicly available in a read-only manner.

# 3. IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

## 3.1 Naming

 No stipulation.

### 3.1.1 Types of names

When the `subject:commonName` of a Certificate issued to an Individual does not contain a Mailbox Address, it is specified as a Personal Name or `subject:pseudonym` as described in [Section 7.1.4.2.2](#71422-subject-distinguished-name-fields)(a). 

Personal Names MUST be a meaningful representation of the Subject’s name as verified in the identifying documentation or Enterprise RA records. 

Names consisting of multiple words are permitted. Given names joined with a hyphen are considered as one single given name. Subjects with more than one given name MAY choose one or several of their given names in any sequence.  Subjects MAY chose name order in accordance with national preference. 

The CA MAY allow common variations or abbreviations of Personal Names consistent with local practice. 

### 3.1.2 Need for names to be meaningful

No stipulation.

### 3.1.3 Anonymity or pseudonymity of subscribers

The purpose of the `subject:pseudonym` attribute is to provide a unique identifier linked to an Individual in a pseudonymized manner when certain privacy conditions are required. For example, a Pseudonym may be used if a government agency requires officials to sign certain decisions via S/MIME so those decisions trace back to individuals, but emphasize the importance of the role over Individual identity in the Certificate. The CA must disclose in its CP and/or CPS if it allows the use of Pseudonyms.

For `sponsor-validated` certificates, the CA MAY use a `subject:pseudonym` attribute in the Certificate if approved by an Enterprise RA and the associated Subject has been verified according to [Section 3.2.4](#324-authentication-of-individual-identity). If present, the `subject:pseudonym` attribute MUST be: 
  1. either a unique identifier selected by the CA for the Subject of the Certificate; or
  2. an identifier selected by the Enterprise RA which uniquely identifies the Subject of the Certificate within the Organization included in the `subject:organizationName` attribute.

For `individual-validated` certificates, the CA MAY use the `subject:pseudonym` attribute if the associated Subject has been verified according to [Section 3.2.4](#324-authentication-of-individual-identity). If present, the `subject:pseudonym` attribute MUST be: 
  1. either a unique identifier selected by the CA for the Subject of the Certificate; or
  2. an identifier verified based on government-issued identity documents.

Pseudonym Certificates are not anonymous. CAs and Enterprise RAs SHALL treat Individual identity information relating to a Pseudonym as private in accordance with [Section 9.4.2](#942-information-treated-as-private).

### 3.1.4 Rules for interpreting various name forms

In cases where names use diacritics or other characters that are not supported by Relying Party applications, the CA SHOULD define substitution rules in its CP and/or CPS.  For example, regardless of capitalization:

*  Accent characters MAY be represented by their ASCII equivalent. For example é, à, í, ñ, or ç MAY be represented by e, a, i, n, or c.
*  Umlaut-accented characters such as ä, ö, ü MAY be represented by either ae, oe, ue or a, o, u.

### 3.1.5 Uniqueness of names

No stipulation.

### 3.1.6 Recognition, authentication, and role of trademarks

No stipulation.

## 3.2 Initial identity validation

The CA SHALL authenticate the identity attributes of the Subject and their control over the email addresses to be included in the S/MIME Certificate according to the requirements of the following sections:

| Type    | Mailbox Control | Organization Identity | Individual Identity | 
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Mailbox-validated | Section 3.2.2  | NA | NA | 
| Organization-validated |  Section 3.2.2  | Section 3.2.3 | NA |
| Sponsored-validated | Section 3.2.2 | Section 3.2.3 | Section 3.2.4 | 
| Individual-validated | Section 3.2.2 | NA | Section 3.2.4 | 

### 3.2.1 Method to prove possession of private key

No stipulation.

### 3.2.2 Validation of mailbox authorization or control

This section defines the permitted processes and procedures for confirming the Applicant's control of the email addresses to be included in issued Certificates. 

The CA SHALL verify that Applicant controls the email accounts associated with all email addresses referenced in the Certificate or has been authorized by the email account holder to act on the account holder’s behalf. 

The CA SHALL NOT delegate the verification of mailbox authorization or control.

**Note:** Email addresses MAY be listed in Subscriber Certificates using `rfc822Name` or `otherNames` of `type id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox` in the `subjectAltName` extension, or in Subordinate CA Certificates via `rfc822Name` in permittedSubtrees within the `nameConstraints` extension.

The CA's CP and/or CPS SHALL specify the procedures that the CA employs to perform this verification. CAs SHALL maintain a record of which domain validation method, including the relevant version number from the Baseline Requirements or S/MIME Baseline Requirements, used to validate every domain or email address in issued Certificates.

Completed validations of Applicant authority MAY be valid for the issuance of multiple Certificates over time. In all cases, the validation SHALL have been initiated within the time period specified in the relevant requirement (such as [Section 4.2.1](#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions)) prior to Certificate issuance.

#### 3.2.2.1 Validating authority over mailbox via domain

The CA MAY confirm the Applicant, such as an Enterprise RA, has been authorized by the email account holder to act on the account holder’s behalf by verifying the entity's control over the domain portion of the email address to be used in the Certificate.

The CA SHALL use only the approved methods in Section 3.2.2.4 of the TLS Baseline Requirements to perform this verification.

For purposes of domain validation, the term Applicant includes the Applicant's Parent Company, Subsidiary Company, or Affiliate.

#### 3.2.2.2 Validating control over mailbox via email

The CA MAY confirm the Applicant's control over each `rfc822Name` or `otherName` of type `id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox` to be included in a Certificate by sending a Random Value via email and then receiving a confirming response utilizing the Random Value. 

Control over each email address SHALL be confirmed using a unique Random Value. The Random Value SHALL be sent only to the email address being validated and SHALL not be shared in any other way. 

The Random Value SHALL be unique in each email. The Random Value SHALL remain valid for use in a confirming response for no more than 24 hours from its creation. The CA MAY specify a shorter validity period for Random Values in its CP and/or CPS.  

The Random Value SHALL be reset upon each instance of the email sent by the CA and, if intended for additional use as an authentication factor, upon first use. 

#### 3.2.2.3 Validating applicant as operator of associated mail server(s)

Confirming the Applicant's control over each `rfc822Name` , `otherName` of `type id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox` to be included in the Certificate, by confirming control of the SMTP FQDN to which a message delivered to the email address should be directed. The SMTP FQDN MUST be identified using the address resolution algorithm defined in [RFC 5321 Section 5.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321#section-5.1) which determines which SMTP FQDNs are authoritative for a given email address. If more than one SMTP FQDNs have been discovered, the CA MUST verify control of an SMTP FQDN following the selection process at [RFC 5321 Section 5.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321#section-5.1). Aliases in MX record RDATA MUST NOT be used for this validation method.

When confirming the Applicant's control of the SMTP FQDN, the CA SHALL use only the approved methods in Section 3.2.2.4 of the TLS Baseline Requirements.

This method is suitable for validating control of all email addresses under a single domain.

#### 3.2.2.4 CAA records

This version of the S/MIME Baseline Requirements does not require the CA to check for CAA records. The CAA property tags for `issue`, `issuewild`, and `iodef` as specified in [RFC 8659](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8659) are not recognized for the issuance of S/MIME Certificates.

### 3.2.3 Authentication of organization identity

The following requirements MUST be fulfilled to authenticate Organization identity included in the `Organization-validated` and `Sponsor-validated` Certificate types.

#### 3.2.3.1 Verification requirements – overview

The CA MUST implement verification processes to confirm and document the following requirements associated with the `subject:organizationName` attribute:

1. Verify Applicant's existence and identity, including;

   A.  Verify the Applicant's legal existence and identity;

   B.  Verify the Applicant's physical existence (business presence at a physical address); and

   C.  Verify the Applicant's operational existence (business activity).

2. Verify a reliable means of communication with the entity to be named as the Subject in the Certificate;

3. Verify the Applicant's authorization for the S/MIME Certificate, including;

   A.  Verify the name, title, and authority of the Contract Signer, Certificate Approver, and Certificate Requester,

   B.  Verify that a Contract Signer signed the Subscriber Agreement or that a duly authorized Applicant Representative acknowledged and agreed to the Terms of Use; and

   C.  Verify that a Certificate Approver has signed or otherwise approved the S/MIME Certificate Request.

As a general rule, the CA is responsible for taking all verification steps reasonably necessary to satisfy each of the Verification Requirements set forth in the subsections below. The Acceptable Methods of Verification set forth in [Section 3.2.3](#323-authentication-of-organization-identity) and [Section 3.2.6](#326-validation-of-authority) (which usually include alternatives) are considered to be the minimum acceptable level of verification required of the CA.  In all cases, however, the CA is responsible for taking any additional verification steps that may be reasonably necessary under the circumstances to satisfy the applicable Verification Requirement.

##### 3.2.3.1.1 Disclosure of verification sources

Prior to the use of an Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency to fulfill these verification requirements, the CA MUST publicly disclose Agency Information about the Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency. This disclosure SHALL be through an appropriate and readily accessible online means.

This Agency Information SHALL include at least the following:

* Sufficient information to unambiguously identify the Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency (such as a name, jurisdiction, and website); 
* The accepted value or values for each of the 2 character ISO 3166 country codes and the 2 character ISO 316-2 identifier for the subdivision (state or province) of the `subject:organizationIdentifier` field, when a Certificate is issued using information from that Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency, indicating the jurisdiction(s) that the Agency is appropriate for; 
* The acceptable form or syntax of Registration Numbers used by the Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency, if the CA restricts such Numbers to an acceptable form or syntax; and
* A revision history that includes a unique version number and date of publication for any additions, modifications, and/or removals from this list.

The CA MUST document where to obtain this information within Section 3.2 of the CA's CP and/or CPS.

#### 3.2.3.2 Verification of applicant's legal existence and identity

##### 3.2.3.2.2 Acceptable methods of verification

1. **Private Organization Subjects**: Unless verified under subsection (6), all items listed in [Section 3.2.3.2.1](#32321-verification-requirements) (1) MUST be verified directly with, or obtained directly from, the Incorporating or Registration Agency in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration. Such verification MAY be through use of a Qualified Government Information Source operated by, or on behalf of, the Incorporating or Registration Agency, or by direct contact with the Incorporating or Registration Agency in person or via mail, email, Web address, or telephone, using an address or phone number obtained directly from the Qualified Government Information Source, Incorporating or Registration Agency, or from a Qualified Independent Information Source.

2. **Government Entity Subjects**: Unless verified under subsection (6), all items listed in [Section 3.2.3.2.1](#32321-verification-requirements) (2) MUST either be verified directly with, or obtained directly from, one of the following:
   i. a Qualified Government Information Source in the political subdivision in which such Government Entity operates;
   ii. a superior governing Government Entity in the same political subdivision as the Applicant (e.g. a Secretary of State may verify the legal existence of a specific State Department), or
   iii. from a judge that is an active member of the federal, state or local judiciary within that political subdivision.

   Any communication from a judge SHALL be verified in the same manner as is used for verifying factual assertions that are asserted by an Attorney as set forth in [Section 3.2.8.1](#3281-verified-legal-opinion).

   Such verification MAY be by direct contact with the appropriate Government Entity in person or via mail, email, Web address, or telephone, using an address or phone number obtained from a Qualified Independent Information Source.

3. **Business Entity Subjects**: Unless verified under subsection (6), Items listed in [Section 3.2.3.2.1](#32321-verification-requirements) (3) (A) through (C) above, MUST be verified directly with, or obtained directly from, the Registration Agency in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Registration. Such verification MAY be performed by means of a Qualified Government Information Source, a Qualified Governmental Tax Information Source, or by direct contact with the Registration Agency in person or via mail, email, Web address, or telephone, using an address or phone number obtained directly from the Qualified Government Information Source, Qualified Governmental Tax Information Source or Registration Agency, or from a Qualified Independent Information Source. In addition, the CA MUST validate a Principal Individual associated with the Business Entity pursuant to the requirements in subsection (4), below.

4. **Principal Individual**: A Principal Individual associated with the Business Entity MUST be validated in a face-to-face setting. The CA MAY rely upon a face-to-face validation of the Principal Individual performed by the Registration Agency, provided that the CA has evaluated the validation procedure and concluded that it satisfies the requirements for face-to-face validation procedures. Where no face-to-face validation was conducted by the Registration Agency, or the Registration Agency's face-to-face validation procedure does not comply with this Requirement, the CA SHALL perform face-to-face validation.

   A.  **Face-To-Face Validation**: The face-to-face validation MUST be conducted before either an employee of the CA, a Latin Notary, a Notary (or equivalent in the Applicant's jurisdiction), a Lawyer, or Accountant (Third-Party Validator). The Principal Individual(s) MUST present the following documentation (Vetting Documents) directly to the Third-Party Validator:

       i. A Personal Statement that includes the following information:

          1. Full name or names by which a person is, or has been, known (including all other names used);
          2. Residential Address at which he/she can be located;

       The Third-Party Validator performing the face-to-face validation MUST:

         i. Attest to the signing of the Personal Statement and the identity of the signer; and
         ii. Identify the original Vetting Documents used to perform the identification. In addition, the Third-Party Validator MUST attest on a copy of the current signed government-issued photo identification document that it is a full, true, and accurate reproduction of the original.

   B.  **Verification of Third-Party Validator**: The CA MUST independently verify that the Third-Party Validator is a legally-qualified Latin Notary or Notary (or legal equivalent in the Applicant's jurisdiction), lawyer, or accountant in the jurisdiction of the Individual's residency, and that the Third-Party Validator actually did perform the services and did attest to the signature of the Individual.

   C.  **Cross-checking of Information**: The CA MUST obtain the signed and attested Personal Statement together with the attested copy of the current signed government-issued photo identification document. The CA MUST review the documentation to determine that the information is consistent, matches the information in the application, and identifies the Individual. The CA MAY rely on electronic copies of this documentation, provided that:

       i. the CA confirms their authenticity (not improperly modified when compared with the underlying original) with the Third-Party Validator; and
       ii. electronic copies of similar kinds of documents are recognized as legal substitutes for originals under the laws of the CA's jurisdiction.

5. **Non-Commercial Entity Subjects (International Organization)**: Unless verified under subsection (6), all items listed in [Section 3.2.3.2.1](#32321-verification-requirements) (4) MUST be verified either:

   A.  With reference to the constituent document under which the International Organization was formed; or
   B.  Directly with a signatory country's government in which the CA is permitted to do business. Such verification MAY be obtained from an appropriate government agency or from the laws of that country, or by verifying that the country's government has a mission to represent it at the International Organization; or
   C.  Directly against any current list of qualified entities that the CA/Browser Forum may maintain at https://www.cabforum.org
   D.  In cases where the International Organization applying for the S/MIME Certificate is an organ or agency - including a non-governmental organization of a verified International Organization, then the CA MAY verify the International Organization Applicant directly with the verified umbrella International Organization of which the Applicant is an organ or agency.

6. The CA MAY rely on a Verified Professional Letter to establish the Applicant's information listed in (1)-(5) above if:

   i. the Verified Professional Letter includes a copy of supporting documentation used to establish the Applicant's legal existence, such as a certificate of registration, articles of incorporation, operating agreement, statute, or regulatory act, and
   ii. the CA confirms the Applicant's organization name specified in the Verified Professional Letter with a QIIS or QGIS.

#### 3.2.3.3 Verification of applicant's legal existence and identity – assumed name

##### 3.2.3.3.1 Verification requirements

If, in addition to the Applicant's formal legal name, as recorded with the applicable Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration, the Applicant's identity, as asserted in the S/MIME Certificate, is to contain any assumed name (also known as "doing business as", "DBA", or "d/b/a" in the US, and "trading as" in the UK) under which the Applicant conducts business, the CA MUST verify that:

   i. the Applicant has registered its use of the assumed name with the appropriate government agency for such filings in the jurisdiction of its Place of Business (as verified in accordance with the S/MIME Baseline Requirements); and
   ii. that such filing continues to be valid.

##### 3.2.3.3.2 Acceptable methods of verification

The CA or RA registration agent SHALL have access to authoritative sources of information on document appearance and validation for forms of identity document accepted by the CA.  

The CA or RA MUST retain information sufficient to evidence the fulfillment of the identity validation process and the verified attributes. In addition to identity attributes, the CA or RA SHALL record the following information: issuer, validity period, and the document's unique identification number.

Automated and manual processes MAY be used in combination, (for example the CA or RA may deploy automated tools to support the work of a registration agent, or an automated process that falls back to a registration agent if the process yields an uncertain result).

2.	**Validation of a digital identity document**

The CA or RA SHALL only accept digital identity documents if the issuer's digital signature on the document is successfully validated according to ICAO 9303 part 11.

The CA or RA SHALL record information obtained from the digital identity document to evidence the identity proofing process. In addition to identity attributes and face photo, the following information SHALL be recorded: issuer, validity period, and the document's unique identification number.

The CA or RA registration agent MUST make a visual comparison of the physical appearance of the Applicant and the face photo and/or other information on the digital identity document.

Automated and manual processes MAY be used in combination, (for example using automated tools to support the work of a registration agent, or an automated process that falls back to a registration agent if the process yields an uncertain result).

3.	**Validation of digital signature with certificate** 

If a digital signature with Certificate is used as evidence, the signature MUST be created as part of the identity validation process.

The CA or RA MUST validate the digital signature and SHALL only use the signing Certificate as evidence for identity attributes if the signature is valid.

If required identity attributes to be collected are not present in the Certificate, the CA or RA SHALL collect these attributes from other sources and validated.

   B.  The Confirming Person's telephone/fax number is verified by the CA to be a telephone number that is part of the organization's telephone system, and is not the personal phone number for the person.

### 3.2.8.5 Qualified independent information source

A Qualified Independent Information Source (QIIS) is a regularly-updated and publicly available database that is generally recognized as a dependable source for certain information. A database qualifies as a QIIS if the CA determines that:

1. Industries other than the CA sector rely on the database for accurate location, contact, or other information; and

2. The database provider updates its data on at least an annual basis.

The CA SHALL use a documented process to check the accuracy of the database and ensure its data is acceptable, including reviewing the database provider's terms of use. The CA SHALL NOT use any data in a QIIS that the CA knows is

1.  Self-reported; and
2.  Not verified by the QIIS as accurate.

Databases in which the CA or its owners or Affiliated companies maintain a controlling interest, or in which any Registration Authorities or subcontractors to whom the CA has outsourced any portion of the vetting process (or their owners or Affiliated companies) maintain any ownership or beneficial interest, do not qualify as a QIIS.

### 3.2.8.6 Qualified government information source

A Qualified Government Information Source (QGIS) is a regularly-updated and current, publicly available, database designed for the purpose of accurately providing the information for which it is consulted, and which is generally recognized as a dependable source of such information provided that it is maintained by a Government Entity, the reporting of data is required by law, and false or misleading reporting is punishable with criminal or civil penalties. Nothing in these Guidelines prohibits the use of third-party vendors to obtain the information from the Government Entity provided that the third party obtains the information directly from the Government Entity.

### 3.2.8.7 Qualified government tax information source

A Qualified Government Tax Information Source is a Qualified Government Information Source that specifically contains tax information relating to Private Organizations, Business Entities or Individuals (e.g., the IRS in the United States).

### 3.2.8.8 Regulated professions information source

A Regulated Professions Information Source is a Qualified Government Information Source or other government-approved, regularly-updated, and publicly available database that contains information on information on regulated professions (e.g., where access and exercise of a professional Title is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification).

3. The CA obtains evidence that the Subscriber's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise;
4. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that can easily compute the Subscriber's Private Key based on the Public Key in the Certificate (such as a Debian weak key, see <https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys>);
5. The CA obtains evidence that the validation of domain authorization or mailbox control for any email address in the Certificate should not be relied upon.

The CA SHOULD revoke a Certificate within 24 hours and MUST revoke a Certificate within 5 days if one or more of the following occurs:

1. The Certificate no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and [Section 6.1.6](#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);
2. The CA obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused;
3. The CA is made aware that a Subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use;
4. The CA is made aware of any circumstance indicating that use of an email address or Fully-Qualified Domain Name in the Certificate is no longer legally permitted (e.g. a court or arbitrator has revoked the right to use an email address or Domain Name, a relevant licensing or services agreement between the Subscriber has terminated, or the account holder has failed to maintain the active status of the email address or Domain Name);
5. The CA is made aware of a material change in the information contained in the Certificate;
6. The CA is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with these Requirements or the CA's CP and/or CPS;
7. The CA determines or is made aware that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate;

9.  Revocation is required by the CA's CP and/or CPS; or
10. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Subscriber's Private Key to compromise or if there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed.

#### 4.9.1.2 Reasons for revoking a subordinate CA certificate

The Issuing CA SHALL revoke a Subordinate CA Certificate within seven (7) days if one or more of the following occurs:

1. The Subordinate CA requests revocation in writing;
2. The Subordinate CA notifies the Issuing CA that the original Certificate Request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization;
3. The Issuing CA obtains evidence that the Subordinate CA's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise or no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and [Section 6.1.6](#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);

### 4.9.2 Who can request revocation

The Subscriber, RA, or Issuing CA can initiate revocation. Additionally, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties MAY submit Certificate Problem Reports informing the Issuing CA of reasonable cause to revoke a Certificate.

### 4.9.3 Procedure for revocation request

The CA SHALL provide a process for Subscribers to request revocation of their own Certificates. The process MUST be described in the CA's CP and/or CPS. The CA SHALL maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports.

The CA SHALL provide clear instructions for reporting suspected Private Key Compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA SHALL publicly disclose the instructions through a readily accessible online means and in Section 1.5.2 of their CPS.

### 4.9.4 Revocation request grace period

No stipulation.

### 4.9.5 Time within which CA must process the revocation request

Within 24 hours after receiving a Certificate Problem Report, the CA SHALL investigate the facts and circumstances related to a Certificate Problem Report and provide a preliminary report on its findings to both the Subscriber and the entity who filed the Certificate Problem Report.

After reviewing the facts and circumstances, the CA SHALL work with the Subscriber and any entity reporting the Certificate Problem Report or other revocation-related notice to establish whether or not the Certificate will be revoked, and if so, a date on which the CA will revoke the Certificate. The period from receipt of the Certificate Problem Report or revocation-related notice to published revocation MUST NOT exceed the time frame set forth in [Section 4.9.1.1](#4911-reasons-for-revoking-a-subscriber-certificate). The date selected by the CA SHOULD consider the following criteria:

1. The nature of the alleged problem (scope, context, severity, magnitude, risk of harm);
2. The consequences of revocation (direct and collateral impacts to Subscribers and Relying Parties);
3. The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;
4. The entity making the complaint (for example, a complaint from a law enforcement official that a Web site is engaged in illegal activities should carry more weight than a complaint from a consumer alleging that they didn't receive the goods they ordered); and
5. Relevant legislation.
   
### 4.9.6 Revocation checking requirement for relying parties

No stipulation.

**Note**: Following Certificate issuance, a Certificate may be revoked for reasons stated in [Section 4.9](#49-certificate-revocation-and-suspension). Therefore, Relying Parties SHOULD check the revocation status of all Certificates that contain a CDP or OCSP pointer.

### 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency

For the status of Subscriber Certificates: if the CA publishes a CRL, then the CA SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least once every seven days, and the value of the `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than ten days beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates: the CA SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least:

1. once every twelve months; and
2. within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.

The value of the `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than twelve months beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

### 4.9.8 Maximum latency for CRLs

No stipulation.

### 4.9.9 On-line revocation/status checking availability

OCSP responses MUST conform to [RFC 6960](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960) and/or [RFC 5019](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5019). OCSP responses MUST either:

1. Be signed by the CA that issued the Certificates whose revocation status is being checked, or
2. Be signed by an OCSP Responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA that issued the Certificate whose revocation status is being checked.
   
In the latter case, the OCSP signing Certificate MUST contain the ocspSigning EKU (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) and an extension of type `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck`, as defined by [RFC 6960](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960).

### 4.9.10 On-line revocation checking requirements

OCSP responders operated by the CA SHALL support the HTTP GET method, as described in [RFC 6960](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960) and/or [RFC 5019](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5019).

The validity interval of an OCSP response is the difference in time between the thisUpdate and nextUpdate field, inclusive. For purposes of computing differences, a difference of 3,600 seconds SHALL be equal to one hour, and a difference of 86,400 seconds SHALL be equal to one day, ignoring leap-seconds.

For the status of Subscriber Certificates:

1. OCSP responses MUST have a validity interval greater than or equal to eight hours;
2. OCSP responses MUST have a validity interval less than or equal to ten days;
3. For OCSP responses with validity intervals less than sixteen hours, then the CA SHALL update the information provided via an Online Certificate Status Protocol prior to one-half of the validity period before the nextUpdate; and
4. For OCSP responses with validity intervals greater than or equal to sixteen hours, then the CA SHALL update the information provided via an Online Certificate Status Protocol at least eight hours prior to the nextUpdate, and no later than four days after the thisUpdate.
   
For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates, the CA SHALL update information provided via OCSP:

1. at least every twelve months; and
2. within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.

If the OCSP responder receives a request for the status of a Certificate serial number that is "unused", then the responder SHOULD NOT respond with a "good" status. If the OCSP responder is for a CA that is not Technically Constrained in line with [Section 7.1.5](#715-name-constraints), the responder MUST NOT respond with a "good" status for such requests.

The CA SHOULD monitor the OCSP responder for requests for "unused" serial numbers as part of its security response procedures.

A Certificate serial number within an OCSP request is "assigned" if a Certificate with that serial number has been issued by the Issuing CA, using any current or previous key associated with that CA subject, or "unused" if otherwise.

A Root CA Certificate SHOULD NOT contain the `certificatePolicies` extension. If present, the extension MUST conform to the requirements set forth for Certificates issued to Subordinate CAs in [Section 7.1.6.3](#7163-subordinate-ca-certificates).

#### 7.1.6.3 Subordinate CA certificates

A Certificate issued to a Subordinate CA that is not an Affiliate of the Issuing CA:

1. MUST include one or more explicit policy identifiers defined in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) that indicate the Subordinate CA's adherence to and compliance with these Requirements and MAY contain one or more identifiers documented by the Subordinate CA in its CP and/or CPS; and
2. MUST NOT contain the `anyPolicy` identifier (2.5.29.32.0).

A Certificate issued to a Subordinate CA that is an Affiliate of the Issuing CA MUST include a set of policy identifiers from one of the two options below:

1. MUST include one or more explicit policy identifiers defined in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) that indicate the Subordinate CA's adherence to and compliance with these Requirements and MAY contain one or more identifiers documented by the Subordinate CA in its CP and/or CPS; or
2. MUST contain the `anyPolicy` identifier (2.5.29.32.0).

The Subordinate CA and the Issuing CA SHALL represent, in their CP and/or CPS, that all Certificates containing a policy identifier indicating compliance with these Requirements are issued and managed in accordance with these Requirements.

#### 7.1.6.4 Subscriber certificates

A Certificate issued to a Subscriber MUST contain, within the Certificate's `certificatePolicies` extension, a policy identifier that is specified in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers).

The Certificate MAY also contain additional policy identifier(s) defined by the Issuing CA. The Issuing CA SHALL document in its CP and/or CPS that the Certificates it issues containing the specified policy identifier(s) are managed in accordance with these Requirements.

### 7.1.7 Usage of policy constraints extension

No stipulation.

### 7.1.8 Policy qualifiers syntax and semantics

No stipulation.

### 7.1.9 Processing semantics for the critical certificate policies extension

No stipulation.

## 7.2 CRL profile

### 7.2.1 Version number(s)

### 7.2.2 CRL and CRL entry extensions

If present, the `reasonCode` (OID 2.5.29.21) extension MUST NOT be marked critical.

If a CRL entry is for a Root CA or Subordinate CA Certificate, including Cross Certificates, this CRL entry extension MUST be present. If a CRL entry is for a Certificate not technically capable of causing issuance, this CRL entry extension SHOULD be present, but MAY be omitted, subject to the following requirements.

The `CRLReason` indicated MUST NOT be unspecified (0). If the reason for revocation is unspecified, CAs MUST omit `reasonCode` entry extension. The `CRLReason` MUST NOT be certificateHold (6).

If a `reasonCode` CRL entry extension is present, the `CRLReason` MUST indicate the most appropriate reason for revocation of the Certificate, as defined by the CA within its CP/CPS.

## 7.3 OCSP profile

If an OCSP response is for a Root CA or Subordinate CA Certificate, including Cross Certificates, and that Certificate has been revoked, then the `revocationReason` field within the `RevokedInfo` of the `CertStatus` MUST be present.

The `CRLReason` indicated MUST contain a value permitted for CRLs, as specified in [Section 7.2.2](#722-crl-and-crl-entry-extensions).

### 7.3.1 Version number(s)

No stipulation.

The `singleExtensions` of an OCSP response MUST NOT contain the `reasonCode` (OID 2.5.29.21) CRL entry extension.

# 8. COMPLIANCE AUDIT AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS

The CA SHALL at all times:

1. Issue Certificates and operate its PKI in accordance with all law applicable to its business and the Certificates it issues in every jurisdiction in which it operates;
2. Comply with these Requirements;
3. Comply with the audit requirements set forth in this section; and
4. Be licensed as a CA in each jurisdiction where it operates, if licensing is required by the law of such jurisdiction for the issuance of Certificates.

**Implementers' Note**: The CA/Browser Forum continues to improve the S/MIME Baseline Requirements while WebTrust and ETSI also continue to update their audit criteria. We encourage all CAs to conform to each revision herein on the date specified without awaiting a corresponding update to an applicable audit criterion. In the event of a conflict between an existing audit criterion and a revision to the S/MIME Baseline Requirements, we will communicate with the audit community and attempt to resolve any uncertainty, and we will respond to implementation questions directed to <questions@cabforum.org>. 

## 8.1 Frequency or circumstances of assessment

Certificates that are capable of being used to issue new Certificates MUST either be Technically Constrained in line with [Section 7.1.5](#715-name-constraints) and audited in line with [Section 8.8](#88-review-of-enterprise-ra-or-technically-constrained-subordinate-ca) only, or Unconstrained and fully audited in line with all remaining requirements from this section. A Certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new Certificates if it contains an X.509v3 `basicConstraints` extension, with the `cA` boolean set to true and is therefore by definition a Root CA Certificate or a Subordinate CA Certificate.

The period during which the CA issues Certificates SHALL be divided into an unbroken sequence of audit periods. An audit period MUST NOT exceed one year in duration.

If the CA has a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with an audit scheme listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then no pre-issuance readiness assessment is necessary.

If the CA does not have a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then, before issuing Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates, the CA SHALL successfully complete a point-in-time readiness assessment performed in accordance with applicable standards under one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment). The point-in-time readiness assessment SHALL be completed no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates and SHALL be followed by a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificate.

## 8.2 Identity/qualifications of assessor

The CA's audit SHALL be performed by a Qualified Auditor. A Qualified Auditor means a natural person, Legal Entity, or group of natural persons or Legal Entities that collectively possess the following qualifications and skills:

1. Independence from the subject of the audit;
2. The ability to conduct an audit that addresses the criteria specified in an Eligible Audit Scheme (see [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment));
3. Employs individuals who have proficiency in examining Public Key Infrastructure technology, information security tools and techniques, information technology and security auditing, and the third-party attestation function;
4. (For audits conducted in accordance with any one of the ETSI standards) accredited in accordance with ISO 17065 applying the requirements specified in ETSI EN 319 403;
5. (For audits conducted in accordance with the WebTrust standard) licensed by WebTrust;
6. Bound by law, government regulation, or professional code of ethics; and
7. Except in the case of an Internal Government Auditing Agency, maintains Professional Liability/Errors & Omissions insurance with policy limits of at least one million US dollars in coverage.
   
## 8.3 Assessor's relationship to assessed entity

No stipulation.

## 8.4 Topics covered by assessment

The CA SHALL undergo an audit in accordance with one of the following schemes:

1. “WebTrust for CAs v2.2.1 or newer” AND “WebTrust for S/MIME Baseline Requirements vX.X.X or newer”; or
2. "ETSI EN 319 411-1 v1.3.1 or newer", which includes normative references to ETSI EN 319 401 (the latest version of referenced ETSI documents should be applied); or
3. If a Government CA is required by its Certificate Policy to use a different internal audit scheme, it MAY use such scheme provided that the audit either
   a. encompasses all requirements of one of the above schemes or
   b. consists of comparable criteria that are available for public review.
Whichever scheme is chosen, it MUST incorporate periodic monitoring and/or accountability procedures to ensure that its audits continue to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the scheme.

The audit MUST be conducted by a Qualified Auditor, as specified in [Section 8.2](#82-identityqualifications-of-assessor).

For Delegated Third Parties that are not Enterprise RAs, then the CA SHALL obtain an audit report, issued under the auditing standards that underlie the accepted audit schemes found in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), that provides an opinion whether the Delegated Third Party's performance complies with either the Delegated Third Party's practice statement or the CA's CP and/or CPS. If the opinion is that the Delegated Third Party does not comply, then the CA SHALL not allow the Delegated Third Party to continue performing delegated functions.

The audit period for the Delegated Third Party SHALL NOT exceed one year (ideally aligned with the CA's audit). However, if the CA or Delegated Third Party is under the operation, control, or supervision of a Government Entity and the audit scheme is completed over multiple years, then the annual audit MUST cover at least the core controls that are required to be audited annually by such scheme plus that portion of all non-core controls that are allowed to be conducted less frequently, but any non-core control SHALL NOT be audited less often than once every three years.

## 8.5 Actions taken as a result of deficiency

No stipulation.

## 8.6 Communication of results

The Audit Report SHALL state explicitly that it covers the relevant systems and processes used in the issuance of all Certificates that assert one or more of the policy identifiers listed in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers). The CA SHALL make the Audit Report publicly available.

The CA MUST make its Audit Report publicly available no later than three months after the end of the audit period. In the event of a delay greater than three months, the CA SHALL provide an explanatory letter signed by the Qualified Auditor.

The Audit Report MUST contain at least the following clearly-labelled information:

1. Name of the organization being audited;
2. Name and address of the organization performing the audit;
3. The SHA-256 fingerprint of all Roots and Subordinate CA Certificates, including Cross Certificates, that were in-scope of the audit;
4. Audit criteria, with version number(s), that were used to audit each of the Certificates (and associated keys);
5. A list of the CA policy documents, with version numbers, referenced during the audit;
6. Whether the audit assessed a period of time or a point in time;
7. The start date and end date of the Audit Period, for those that cover a period of time;
8. The point in time date, for those that are for a point in time;
9. The date the report was issued, which will necessarily be after the end date or point in time date; 
10. (For audits conducted in accordance with any of the ETSI standards) a statement to indicate if the audit was a full audit or a surveillance audit, and which portions of the criteria were applied and evaluated, e.g., ETSI EN 319 401, ETSI EN 319 411-1 policy LCP, NCP or NCP+, ETSI EN 319 411-2 policy QCP-n, QCP-n-qscd, QCP-l or QCP-l-qscd; and
11. (For audits conducted in accordance with any of the ETSI standards) a statement to indicate that the auditor referenced the applicable CA/Browser Forum criteria, such as this document, and the version used.

An authoritative English language version of the publicly available audit information MUST be provided by the Qualified Auditor and the CA SHALL ensure it is publicly available.

The Audit Report MUST be available as a PDF, and SHALL be text searchable for all information required. Each SHA-256 fingerprint within the Audit Report MUST be uppercase letters and MUST NOT contain colons, spaces, or line feeds.

## 8.7 Self audits

During the period in which the CA issues Certificates, the CA SHALL monitor adherence to its CP and/or CPS and these Requirements and control its service quality by performing self audits on at least a quarterly basis against a randomly selected sample including a minimum of the greater of thirty (30) Certificates or three percent (3%) of the Certificates issued by it during the period commencing immediately after the previous self-audit sample was taken. 

## 8.8 Review of delegated parties 

Except for Delegated Third Parties, Enterprise RAs, and Technically Constrained Subordinate CAs that undergo an annual audit that meets the criteria specified in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), the CA SHALL ensure the practices and procedures of each Delegated Third Party, Enterprise RA, and Technically Constrained Subordinate CA are in compliance with these Requirements and the relevant CP and/or CPS. The CA shall document the obligations of Delegated Third Parties, Enterprise RAs, and Technically Constrained Subordinate CAs and perform internal audits of their adherence with those obligations on an annual basis.

### 9.6.2 RA representations and warranties

No stipulation.

### 9.6.3 Subscriber representations and warranties

The CA SHALL require, as part of the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use, that the Applicant make the commitments and warranties in this section for the benefit of the CA and the Certificate Beneficiaries.

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, the CA SHALL obtain, for the express benefit of the CA and the Certificate Beneficiaries, either the Applicant's:

1. Agreement to the Subscriber Agreement with the CA; or
2. Acknowledgement of the Terms of Use.

The CA SHALL implement a process to ensure that each Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use is legally enforceable against the Applicant. In either case, the Agreement MUST apply to the Certificate to be issued pursuant to the Certificate Request. The CA MAY use an electronic or "click-through" Agreement provided that the CA has determined that such agreements are legally enforceable. A separate Agreement MAY be used for each Certificate Request, or a single Agreement MAY be used to cover multiple future Certificate Requests and the resulting Certificates, so long as each Certificate that the CA issues to the Applicant is clearly covered by that Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use.

The Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use MUST contain provisions imposing on the Applicant itself (or made by the Applicant on behalf of its principal or agent under a subcontractor or hosting service relationship) the following obligations and warranties:

1. **Accuracy of Information**: An obligation and warranty to provide accurate and complete information at all times to the CA, both in the certificate request and as otherwise requested by the CA in connection with the issuance of the Certificate(s) to be supplied by the CA;

7. **Responsiveness**: An obligation to respond to the CA's instructions concerning Key Compromise or Certificate misuse within a specified time period.
8. **Acknowledgment and Acceptance**: An acknowledgment and acceptance that the CA is entitled to revoke the Certificate immediately if the Applicant were to violate the terms of the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use, or if revocation is required by the CA's CP and/or CPS, or by these Requirements.


### 9.6.4 Relying party representations and warranties

No stipulation.

### 9.6.5 Representations and warranties of other participants

No stipulation.

## 9.7 Disclaimers of warranties

No stipulation.

## 9.8 Limitations of liability

For delegated tasks, the CA and any Delegated Third Party MAY allocate liability between themselves contractually as they determine, but the CA SHALL remain fully responsible for the performance of all parties in accordance with these Requirements, as if the tasks had not been delegated.

If the CA has issued and managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its CP and/or CPS, the CA MAY disclaim liability to the Certificate Beneficiaries or any other third parties for any losses suffered as a result of use or reliance on such Certificate beyond those specified in the CA's CP and/or CPS. If the CA has not issued or managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its CP and/or CPS, the CA MAY seek to limit its liability to the Subscriber and to Relying Parties, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved, for any and all claims, losses or damages suffered as a result of the use or reliance on such Certificate by any appropriate means that the CA desires. If the CA chooses to limit its liability for Certificates that are not issued or managed in compliance with these Requirements or its CP and/or CPS, then the CA SHALL include the limitations on liability in the CA's CP and/or CPS.

## 9.9 Indemnities

Notwithstanding any limitations on its liability to Subscribers and Relying Parties, the CA understands and acknowledges that the Application Software Suppliers who have a Root CA Certificate distribution agreement in place with the Root CA do not assume any obligation or potential liability of the CA under these Requirements or that otherwise might exist because of the issuance or maintenance of Certificates or reliance thereon by Relying Parties or others. Thus, except in the case where the CA is a government entity, the CA SHALL defend, indemnify, and hold harmless each Application Software Supplier for any and all claims, damages, and losses suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved. This does not apply, however, to any claim, damages, or loss suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA where such claim, damage, or loss was directly caused by such Application Software Supplier's software displaying as not trustworthy a Certificate that is still valid, or displaying as trustworthy: (1) a Certificate that has expired, or (2) a Certificate that has been revoked (but only in cases where the revocation status is currently available from the CA online, and the application software either failed to check such status or ignored an indication of revoked status).

### 9.16.3 Severability

In the event of a conflict between these Requirements and a law, regulation or government order (hereinafter ‘Law’) of any jurisdiction in which a CA operates or issues Certificates, a CA MAY modify any conflicting requirement to the minimum extent necessary to make the requirement valid and legal in the jurisdiction. This applies only to operations or Certificate issuances that are subject to that Law. In such event, the CA SHALL immediately (and prior to issuing a Certificate under the modified requirement) include in Section 9.16.3 of the CA’s CPS a detailed reference to the Law requiring a modification of these Requirements under this section, and the specific modification to these Requirements implemented by the CA.

The CA SHALL also (prior to issuing a Certificate under the modified requirement) notify the CA/Browser Forum of the relevant information newly added to its CPS by sending a message to <public@cabforum.org> and receiving confirmation that it has been posted to the Public Mailing List and is indexed in the Public Mail Archives available at [https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/](https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/) (or such other email addresses and links as the Forum may designate), so that the CA/Browser Forum may consider possible revisions to these Requirements accordingly.

Any modification to CA practice enabled under this section SHALL be discontinued if and when the Law no longer applies, or these Requirements are modified to make it possible to comply with both them and the Law simultaneously. An appropriate change in practice, modification to the CA’s CPS and a notice to the CA/Browser Forum, as outlined above, SHALL be made within 90 days.

# Appendix A - Registration schemes

The following Registration Schemes are recognized as valid under these guidelines:

* **NTR**:

  For an identifier allocated by a national trade register to a Legal Entity. The country code used in the Registration Scheme identifier SHALL match that of the subject’s jurisdiction in the `subject:countryName` as specified in [Section 7.1.4.2.2](#71422-subject-distinguished-name-fields).

* **VAT**:

  For an identifier allocated by the national tax authorities to a Legal Entity. This information SHALL be validated using information provided by the national tax authority for the entity named in the `subject:organizationName` within the context of the subject’s jurisdiction in the `subject:countryName` as specified in as specified in [Section 7.1.4.2.2](#71422-subject-distinguished-name-fields).

* **PSD**:

  For an authorization number as specified in ETSI TS 119 495 clause 4.4
  allocated to a payment service provider and containing the information as
  specified in ETSI TS 119 495 clause 5.2.1.  This information SHALL be
  obtained directly from the national competent authority register for
  payment services or from an information source approved by a government
  agency, regulatory body, or legislation for this purpose. 
  
  This information SHALL be validated for the entity named in the `subject:organizationName` and registration number within the context of the subject’s jurisdiction in the `subject:countryName` as specified in as specified in [Section 7.1.4.2.2](#71422-subject-distinguished-name-fields).
  
  This information SHALL be validated by being matched directly or indirectly (for example, by matching a globally unique registration number) against the entity named in the `subject:organizationName` within the context of the subject’s jurisdiction in the `subject:countryName` as specified in as specified in [Section 7.1.4.2.2](#71422-subject-distinguished-name-fields).
  The stated address of the organization combined with the organization name
  SHALL NOT be the only information used to disambiguate the organization.

* **LEI**:

  For a global Legal Entity Identifier as specified in ISO 17442 for the entity named in the `subject:organizationName` as specified in [Section 7.1.4.2.2](#71422-subject-distinguished-name-fields). The 2 character ISO 3166 country code SHALL be set to 'XG'. 

  The CA MUST verify that the RegistrationStatus for the LEI record is ISSUED and the EntityStatus is ACTIVE.  An LEI SHALL only be used if the ValidationSources entry is FULLY_CORROBORATED; an LEI MUST NOT be used if ValidationSources entry is PARTIALLY_CORROBORATED, PENDING, or ENTITY_SUPPLIED_ONLY.

# Appendix B - Country-specific interpretative guidelines (normative)

NOTE: This appendix provides alternative interpretations of these Requirements for countries that have a language, cultural, technical, or legal reason for deviating from a strict interpretation of these Requirements. More specific information for particular countries may be added to this appendix in the future.

## 1. Organization names

1. Non-Latin Organization Name

   Where an Applicant's organization name is not registered with a QGIS in _Latin_ characters and the Applicant's non-Latin character organization name and registration have been verified with a QGIS in accordance with these Requirements, a CA MAY include a Latin character organization name in the Certificate. In such a case, the CA MUST follow the procedures laid down in this section.

2. Romanized Names

   In order to include a transliteration/Romanization of the registered name, the Romanization MUST be verified by the CA using a system officially recognized by the Government in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation.

   If the CA can not rely on a transliteration/Romanization of the registered name using a system officially recognized by the Government in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation, then it MUST rely on one of the options below, in order of preference:

   A.  A system recognized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO);
   B.  A system recognized by the United Nations; or
   C.  A Lawyer's Opinion or Accountant's Letter confirming the proper Romanization of the registered name.

3. Translated Name

   In order to include a Latin character name in the Certificate that is not a direct Romanization of the registered name (e.g. an English Name)  the CA MUST verify that the Latin character name is:

   A.  Included in the Articles of Incorporation (or equivalent document) filed as part of the organization registration; or
   B.  Recognized by a QTIS in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation as the Applicant's recognized name for tax filings; or
   C.  Confirmed with a QIIS to be the name associated with the registered organization; or
   D.  Confirmed by a Verified Legal Opinion or Accountant's Letter to be a translated trading name associated with the registered organization.

### Country-specific procedures

#### B-1. Japan

As interpretation of the procedures set out above:

1. Organization Names

   A.  The Revised Hepburn method of Romanization, as well as Kunrei-shiki and Nihon-shiki methods described in ISO 3602, are acceptable for Japanese Romanizations.
   B.  The CA MAY verify the Romanized transliteration, language translation (e.g. English name), or other recognized Roman-letter substitute of the Applicant's formal legal name with either a QIIS, Verified Legal Opinion, or Verified Accountant Letter.
   C.  The CA MAY use the Financial Services Agency to verify a Romanized, translated, or other recognized Roman-letter substitute name. When used, the CA MUST verify that the translated English is recorded in the audited Financial Statements.
   D.  When relying on Articles of Incorporation to verify a Romanized, translated, or other recognized Roman-letter substitute name, the Articles of Incorporation MUST be accompanied either: by a document, signed with the original Japanese Corporate Stamp, that proves that the Articles of Incorporation are authentic and current, or by a Verified Legal Opinion or a Verified Accountant Letter. The CA MUST verify the authenticity of the Corporate Stamp.
   E.
