# 1.  INTRODUCTION

**This is a pre-release draft of the S/MIME Baseline Requirements (SBR) and is undergoing active editing.  It has not yet been balloted to become a CA/Browser Forum standard.**

## 1.1  Overview
This S/MIME Baseline Requirements document describes an integrated set of technologies, protocols, identity-proofing, lifecycle management, and auditing requirements that are necessary for the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates.

An S/MIME Certificate for the purposes of this document can be identified by the existence of an Extended Key Usage (EKU) Object Identifier (OID) of 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4 for `emailProtection` and the inclusion of an email address in the Subject, an `Rfc822Name`, or an `otherName` of type `id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox` in the `subjectAltName` extension.

**Notice for Readers**

An S/MIME Certificate contains a public key bound to an email address and may also contain the identity of a natural person or legal entity that controls such email address. The key pair can then be used to sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt email. 

This Certificate Policy (CP) describes a subset of the requirements that a Certification Authority must meet in order to issue Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates. This document serves two purposes: to specify Baseline Requirements and to provide guidance and requirements for what a CA should include in its Certification Practice Statement (CPS). These Requirements apply only to relevant events that occur on or after DATE (the original effective date of these requirements).

These Requirements do not address all of the issues relevant to the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates. In accordance with RFC 3647 and to facilitate a comparison of other CP and/or CPS (e.g., for policy mapping), this document includes all sections of the RFC 3647 framework. The CA/Browser Forum initially leaves sections blank until a requirement is stated or a decision of “no stipulation” is made. The CA/Browser Forum may update these Requirements from time to time.

These Requirements do not address the issuance or management of Certificates by enterprises that operate their own Public Key Infrastructure for internal purposes only, and for which the Root Certificate is not distributed by any Application Software Supplier. These Requirements are applicable to all Certification Authorities within a chain of trust. They are to be flowed down from the Root CA through successive Subordinate CAs.

## 1.2  Document name and identification
This Certificate Policy contains the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates, as adopted by the CA/Browser Forum.

The following Certificate Policy identifiers are reserved for use by CAs as a means of asserting compliance with this document (OID arc 2.23.140.1.5) as follows:

## 1.3  PKI participants
The CA/Browser Forum is a voluntary organization of Certification Authorities and suppliers of Internet browser and other relying-party software applications including mail user agents (web-based or application based) and email service providers that process S/MIME Certificates.

### 1.3.1  Certification authorities
Certification Authority (CA) is defined in [Section 1.6.1](#161-definitions). Current CA Members of the CA/Browser Forum are listed at https://cabforum.org/members.

### 1.3.2  Registration authorities

With the exception of [Section 3.2.2](#322--validation-of-mailbox-authorization-or-control), the CA MAY delegate the performance of all, or any part, of [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) requirements to a Delegated Third Party, provided that the process as a whole fulfills all of the requirements of [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation).

Before the CA authorizes a Delegated Third Party to perform a delegated function, the CA SHALL contractually require the Delegated Third Party to:

1. Meet the qualification requirements of [Section 5.3.1](#531-qualifications-experience-and-clearance-requirements), when applicable to the delegated function;
2. Retain documentation in accordance with [Section 5.5.2](#552-retention-period-for-archive);
3. Abide by the other provisions of these Requirements that are applicable to the delegated function; and
4. Comply with (a) the CA's CP and/or CPS or (b) the Delegated Third Party's practice statement that the CA has verified complies with these Requirements.

The CA MAY designate an Enterprise Registration Authority (RA) to verify Certificate Requests from the Enterprise RA's own organization.  The CA SHALL NOT accept Certificate Requests authorized by an Enterprise RA unless the following requirements are satisfied:

1. If the Certificate Request is for an Organization-validated or Sponsor-validated, the CA SHALL confirm that the Enterprise RA has authorization or control of the requested email domains in accordance with [Section 3.2.2.1](#3221--validating-authority-over-mailbox-via-domain). The CA SHALL confirm that the Organization name if used is either that of the delegated enterprise, or an Affiliate of the delegated enterprise, or that the delegated enterprise is an agent of the named Subject. For example, the CA SHALL NOT issue a Certificate containing the Subject name "XYZ Co." on the authority of Enterprise RA "ABC Co.", unless the two companies are affiliated as defined in [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) or "ABC Co." is the agent of "XYZ Co". This requirement applies regardless of whether the accompanying requested email domain falls within the subdomains of ABC Co.'s Registered Domain Name.

2. If the Certificate Request is for a Mailbox-validated policy, the CA SHALL confirm that the mailbox holder has control of the requested email domains in accordance with [Section 3.2.2.2](#3222--validating-control-over-mailbox-via-email).

The CA SHALL impose these limitations as a contractual requirement on the Enterprise RA and monitor compliance by the Enterprise RA in accordance with [Section 8.8](#88-review-of-enterprise-ra-or-technically-constrained-subordinate-ca).

### 1.3.3  Subscribers
As defined in [Section 1.6.1](#16-definitions-and-acronyms).

### 1.3.4 Relying parties
“Relying Party” and “Application Software Supplier” are defined in [Section 1.6.1](#16-definitions-and-acronyms). Current Members of the CA/Browser Forum who are Application Software Suppliers are listed at https://cabforum.org/members.

### 1.3.5  Other participants
Other groups that have participated in the development of these Requirements include the CPA Canada WebTrust for Certification Authorities task force.  Participation by CPA Canada does not imply its endorsement, recommendation, or approval of the final product.

## 1.4  Certificate usage
The primary goal of these Requirements is to provide a framework where “reasonable assurance” may be provided to senders and recipients of email messages that the party identified in an S/MIME Certificate has control of the domain or email address being asserted. A variation of this use case is where an individual or organization digitally signs email to establish its authenticity and source of origin.  

### 1.4.1  Appropriate certificate uses
The primary goal of these Requirements is to describe an integrated set of technologies, protocols, identity-proofing, lifecycle management, and auditing requirements for the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates. These Requirements also serve to inform users and help them to make informed decisions when relying on Certificates.

### 1.4.2 Prohibited certificate uses
No stipulation.

## 1.5  Policy administration
This document may be revised from time to time, as appropriate, in accordance with procedures adopted by the CA/Browser Forum.  The CA/Browser Forum welcomes recommendations and suggestions regarding this standard by email at questions@cabforum.org. 

### 1.5.1  Organization administering the document
No stipulation.

### 1.5.2  Contact person
Contact information for the CA/Browser Forum is available at https://cabforum.org/leadership/. In this section of a CA’s CPS, the CA shall provide a link to a web page or an email address for contacting the person or persons responsible for operation of the CA, including contact information for entities wishing to submit a Certificate Problem Report.

### 1.5.3  Person determining CPS suitability for the policy
No stipulation.

### 1.5.4  CPS approval procedures
No stipulation.

## 1.6  Definitions and acronyms
###  1.6.1 Definitions

**Affiliate**: A corporation, partnership, joint venture or other entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with another entity, or an agency, department, political subdivision, or any entity operating under the direct control of a Government Entity.

**Applicant**: The natural person or Legal Entity that applies for (or seeks renewal of) a Certificate. Once the Certificate issues, the Applicant is referred to as the Subscriber. For Certificates issued to devices, the Applicant is the entity that controls or operates the device named in the Certificate, even if the device is sending the actual Certificate Request.

**Applicant Representative**: A natural person or human sponsor who is either the Applicant, employed by the Applicant, or an authorized agent who has express authority to represent the Applicant:

  i. who signs and submits, or approves a Certificate Request on behalf of the Applicant, and/or
  ii. who signs and submits a Subscriber Agreement on behalf of the Applicant, and/or
  iii. who acknowledges the Terms of Use on behalf of the Applicant when the Applicant is an Affiliate of the CA or is the CA.

**Application Software Supplier**: A supplier of Internet browser software or other relying-party application software that displays or uses Certificates and incorporates Root Certificates.

**Attestation Letter**: A letter attesting that Subject Information is correct written by an accountant, lawyer, government official, or other reliable third party customarily relied upon for such information.

**Audit Period**: In a period-of-time audit, the period between the first day (start) and the last day of operations (end) covered by the auditors in their engagement. (This is not the same as the period of time when the auditors are on-site at the CA.) The coverage rules and maximum length of audit periods are defined in [Section 8.1](#81--frequency-or-circumstances-of-assessment).

**Audit Report**: A report from a Qualified Auditor stating the Qualified Auditor's opinion on whether an entity's processes and controls comply with the mandatory provisions of these Requirements.

**Authorization Domain Name**: The FQDN used to obtain authorization for a given FQDN to be included in a Certificate. The CA may use the FQDN returned from a DNS CNAME lookup as the FQDN for the purposes of domain validation. If a Wildcard Domain Name is to be included in a Certificate, then the CA MUST remove "`*.`" from the left-most portion of the Wildcard Domain Name to yield the corresponding FQDN. The CA may prune zero or more Domain Labels of the FQDN from left to right until encountering a Base Domain Name and may use any one of the values that were yielded by pruning (including the Base Domain Name itself) for the purpose of domain validation.

**Authorized Ports**: One of the following ports: 80 (http), 443 (https), 25 (smtp), 22 (ssh).

**Base Domain Name**: The portion of an applied-for FQDN that is the first Domain Name node left of a registry-controlled or public suffix plus the registry-controlled or public suffix (e.g. "example.co.uk" or "example.com"). For FQDNs where the right-most Domain Name node is a gTLD having ICANN Specification 13 in its registry agreement, the gTLD itself may be used as the Base Domain Name.

**CAA**: From RFC 8659 (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8659>): "The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record allows a DNS domain name holder to specify one or more Certification Authorities (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain name. CAA Resource Records allow a public CA to implement additional controls to reduce the risk of unintended certificate mis-issue."

**CA Key Pair**: A Key Pair where the Public Key appears as the Subject Public Key Info in one or more Root CA Certificate(s) and/or Subordinate CA Certificate(s).

**Certificate**: An electronic document that uses a digital signature to bind a public key and an identity.

**Certificate Data**: Certificate requests and data related thereto (whether obtained from the Applicant or otherwise) in the CA's possession or control or to which the CA has access.

**Certificate Management Process**: Processes, practices, and procedures associated with the use of keys, software, and hardware, by which the CA verifies Certificate Data, issues Certificates, maintains a Repository, and revokes Certificates.

**Certificate Policy**: A set of rules that indicates the applicability of a named Certificate to a particular community and/or PKI implementation with common security requirements.

**Certificate Problem Report**: Complaint of suspected Key Compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, or inappropriate conduct related to Certificates.

**Certificate Revocation List**: A regularly updated time-stamped list of revoked Certificates that is created and digitally signed by the CA that issued the Certificates.

**Certification Authority**: An organization that is responsible for the creation, issuance, revocation, and management of Certificates. The term applies equally to both Roots CAs and Subordinate CAs.

**Certification Practice Statement**: One of several documents forming the governance framework in which Certificates are created, issued, managed, and used.

**Control**: "Control" (and its correlative meanings, "controlled by" and "under common control with") means possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to: (1) direct the management, personnel, finances, or plans of such entity; (2) control the election of a majority of the directors ; or (3) vote that portion of voting shares required for "control" under the law of the entity's Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration but in no case less than 10%.

**Country**: Either a member of the United Nations OR a geographic region recognized as a Sovereign State by at least two UN member nations.

**Cross Certificate**: A certificate that is used to establish a trust relationship between two Root CAs.

**CSPRNG**: A random number generator intended for use in cryptographic system.

**Delegated Third Party**: A natural person or Legal Entity that is not the CA but is authorized by the CA, and whose activities are not within the scope of the appropriate CA audits, to assist in the Certificate Management Process by performing or fulfilling one or more of the CA requirements found herein.

**DNS CAA Email Contact**: The email address defined in [Appendix A.1.1](#a11-caa-contactemail-property).

**DNS CAA Phone Contact**: The phone number defined in [Appendix A.1.2](#a12-caa-contactphone-property).

**DNS TXT Record Phone Contact**: The phone number defined in [Appendix A.2.2](#a22-dns-txt-record-phone-contact).

**Domain Authorization Document**: Documentation provided by, or a CA's documentation of a communication with, a Domain Name Registrar, the Domain Name Registrant, or the person or entity listed in WHOIS as the Domain Name Registrant (including any private, anonymous, or proxy registration service) attesting to the authority of an Applicant to request a Certificate for a specific Domain Namespace.

**Domain Contact**: The Domain Name Registrant, technical contact, or administrative contact (or the equivalent under a ccTLD) as listed in the WHOIS record of the Base Domain Name or in a DNS SOA record, or as obtained through direct contact with the Domain Name Registrar.

**Domain Label**: From RFC 8499 (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8499>): "An ordered list of zero or more octets that makes up a portion of a domain name. Using graph theory, a label identifies one node in a portion of the graph of all possible domain names."

**Domain Name**: An ordered list of one or more Domain Labels assigned to a node in the Domain Name System.

**Domain Namespace**: The set of all possible Domain Names that are subordinate to a single node in the Domain Name System.

**Domain Name Registrant**: Sometimes referred to as the "owner" of a Domain Name, but more properly the person(s) or entity(ies) registered with a Domain Name Registrar as having the right to control how a Domain Name is used, such as the natural person or Legal Entity that is listed as the "Registrant" by WHOIS or the Domain Name Registrar.

**Domain Name Registrar**: A person or entity that registers Domain Names under the auspices of or by agreement with:

  i. the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN),
  ii. a national Domain Name authority/registry, or
  iii. a Network Information Center (including their affiliates, contractors, delegates, successors, or assignees).

**Enterprise RA**: An employee or agent of an organization unaffiliated with the CA who authorizes issuance of Certificates to that organization.

**Fully-Qualified Domain Name**: A Domain Name that includes the Domain Labels of all superior nodes in the Internet Domain Name System.

**Government Entity**: A government-operated legal entity, agency, department, ministry, branch, or similar element of the government of a country, or political subdivision within such country (such as a state, province, city, county, etc.).

**High Risk Certificate Request**: A Request that the CA flags for additional scrutiny by reference to internal criteria and databases maintained by the CA, which may include names at higher risk for phishing or other fraudulent usage, names contained in previously rejected Certificate Requests or revoked Certificates, names listed on the Miller Smiles phishing list or the Google Safe Browsing list, or names that the CA identifies using its own risk-mitigation criteria.

**Internal Name**: A string of characters (not an IP address) in a Common Name or Subject Alternative Name field of a Certificate that cannot be verified as globally unique within the public DNS at the time of certificate issuance because it does not end with a Top Level Domain registered in IANA's Root Zone Database.

**Issuing CA**: In relation to a particular Certificate, the CA that issued the Certificate. This could be either a Root CA or a Subordinate CA.

**Key Compromise**: A Private Key is said to be compromised if its value has been disclosed to an unauthorized person, or an unauthorized person has had access to it.

**Key Generation Script**: A documented plan of procedures for the generation of a CA Key Pair.

**Key Pair**: The Private Key and its associated Public Key.

**LDH Label**: From RFC 5890 (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5890>): "A string consisting of ASCII letters, digits, and the hyphen with the further restriction that the hyphen cannot appear at the beginning or end of the string. Like all DNS labels, its total length must not exceed 63 octets."

**Legal Entity**: An association, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, trust, government entity or other entity with legal standing in a country's legal system.

**Non-Reserved LDH Label**: From RFC 5890 (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5890>): "The set of valid LDH labels that do not have '--' in the third and fourth positions."

**Object Identifier**: A unique alphanumeric or numeric identifier registered under the International Organization for Standardization's applicable standard for a specific object or object class.

**OCSP Responder**: An online server operated under the authority of the CA and connected to its Repository for processing Certificate status requests. See also, Online Certificate Status Protocol.

**Online Certificate Status Protocol**: An online Certificate-checking protocol that enables relying-party application software to determine the status of an identified Certificate. See also OCSP Responder.

**Parent Company**: A company that Controls a Subsidiary Company.

**P-Label**: A XN-Label that contains valid output of the Punycode algorithm (as defined in RFC 3492, Section 6.3) from the fifth and subsequent positions.

**Private Key**: The key of a Key Pair that is kept secret by the holder of the Key Pair, and that is used to create Digital Signatures and/or to decrypt electronic records or files that were encrypted with the corresponding Public Key.

**Public Key**: The key of a Key Pair that may be publicly disclosed by the holder of the corresponding Private Key and that is used by a Relying Party to verify Digital Signatures created with the holder's corresponding Private Key and/or to encrypt messages so that they can be decrypted only with the holder's corresponding Private Key.

**Public Key Infrastructure**: A set of hardware, software, people, procedures, rules, policies, and obligations used to facilitate the trustworthy creation, issuance, management, and use of Certificates and keys based on Public Key Cryptography.

**Publicly-Trusted Certificate**: A Certificate that is trusted by virtue of the fact that its corresponding Root Certificate is distributed as a trust anchor in widely-available application software.

**Qualified Auditor**: A natural person or Legal Entity that meets the requirements of [Section 8.2](#82-identityqualifications-of-assessor).

**Random Value**: A value specified by a CA to the Applicant that exhibits at least 112 bits of entropy.

**Registered Domain Name**: A Domain Name that has been registered with a Domain Name Registrar.

**Registration Authority (RA)**: Any Legal Entity that is responsible for identification and authentication of subjects of Certificates, but is not a CA, and hence does not sign or issue Certificates. An RA may assist in the certificate application process or revocation process or both. When "RA" is used as an adjective to describe a role or function, it does not necessarily imply a separate body, but can be part of the CA.

**Reliable Data Source**: An identification document or source of data used to verify Subject Identity Information that is generally recognized among commercial enterprises and governments as reliable, and which was created by a third party for a purpose other than the Applicant obtaining a Certificate.

**Reliable Method of Communication**: A method of communication, such as a postal/courier delivery address, telephone number, or email address, that was verified using a source other than the Applicant Representative.

**Relying Party**: Any natural person or Legal Entity that relies on a Valid Certificate. An Application Software Supplier is not considered a Relying Party when software distributed by such Supplier merely displays information relating to a Certificate.

**Repository**: An online database containing publicly-disclosed PKI governance documents (such as Certificate Policies and Certification Practice Statements) and Certificate status information, either in the form of a CRL or an OCSP response.

**Request Token**: A value, derived in a method specified by the CA which binds this demonstration of control to the Certificate Request. The CA SHOULD define within its CPS (or a document clearly referenced by the CPS) the format and method of Request Tokens it accepts.

The Request Token SHALL incorporate the key used in the Certificate Request.

A Request Token MAY include a timestamp to indicate when it was created.

A Request Token MAY include other information to ensure its uniqueness.

A Request Token that includes a timestamp SHALL remain valid for no more than 30 days from the time of creation.

A Request Token that includes a timestamp SHALL be treated as invalid if its timestamp is in the future.

A Request Token that does not include a timestamp is valid for a single use and the CA SHALL NOT re-use it for a subsequent validation.

The binding SHALL use a digital signature algorithm or a cryptographic hash algorithm at least as strong as that to be used in signing the Certificate Request.

**Note**: Examples of Request Tokens include, but are not limited to:

  i. a hash of the public key; or
  ii. a hash of the Subject Public Key Info [X.509]; or
  iii. a hash of a PKCS#10 CSR.

A Request Token may also be concatenated with a timestamp or other data. If a CA wanted to always use a hash of a PKCS#10 CSR as a Request Token and did not want to incorporate a timestamp and did want to allow certificate key re-use then the applicant might use the challenge password in the creation of a CSR with OpenSSL to ensure uniqueness even if the subject and key are identical between subsequent requests.

**Note**: This simplistic shell command produces a Request Token which has a timestamp and a hash of a CSR.
  ``echo `date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M` `sha256sum <r2.csr` \| sed "s/[ -]//g"``
The script outputs:
  201602251811c9c863405fe7675a3988b97664ea6baf442019e4e52fa335f406f7c5f26cf14f

**Required Website Content**: Either a Random Value or a Request Token, together with additional information that uniquely identifies the Subscriber, as specified by the CA.

**Requirements**: The Baseline Requirements found in this document.

**Reserved IP Address**: An IPv4 or IPv6 address that is contained in the address block of any entry in either of the following IANA registries:

[https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml)

[https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xhtml)

**Root CA**: The top level Certification Authority whose Root Certificate is distributed by Application Software Suppliers and that issues Subordinate CA Certificates.

**Root Certificate**: The self-signed Certificate issued by the Root CA to identify itself and to facilitate verification of Certificates issued to its Subordinate CAs.

**Sovereign State**: A state or country that administers its own government, and is not dependent upon, or subject to, another power.

**Subject**: The natural person, device, system, unit, or Legal Entity identified in a Certificate as the Subject. The Subject is either the Subscriber or a device under the control and operation of the Subscriber.

**Subject Identity Information**: Information that identifies the Certificate Subject. Subject Identity Information does not include a Domain Name listed in the `subjectAltName` extension or the Subject `commonName` field.

**Subordinate CA**: A Certification Authority whose Certificate is signed by the Root CA, or another Subordinate CA.

**Subscriber**: A natural person or Legal Entity to whom a Certificate is issued and who is legally bound by a Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use.

**Subscriber Agreement**: An agreement between the CA and the Applicant/Subscriber that specifies the rights and responsibilities of the parties.

**Subsidiary Company**: A company that is controlled by a Parent Company.

**Technically Constrained Subordinate CA Certificate**: A Subordinate CA certificate which uses a combination of Extended Key Usage settings and Name Constraint settings to limit the scope within which the Subordinate CA Certificate may issue Subscriber or additional Subordinate CA Certificates.

**Terms of Use**: Provisions regarding the safekeeping and acceptable uses of a Certificate issued in accordance with these Requirements when the Applicant/Subscriber is an Affiliate of the CA or is the CA.

### 3.2.1  Method to prove possession of private key

### 3.2.2  Validation of mailbox authorization or control

This section defines the permitted processes and procedures for confirming the Applicant's control of the email addresses to be included in issued Certificates. 

The CA SHALL verify that Applicant controls the email accounts associated with all email addresses referenced in the Certificate or has been authorized by the email account holder to act on the account holder’s behalf. 

The CA SHALL NOT delegate the verification of mailbox authorization or control.

**Note:** Email addresses may be listed in Subscriber Certificates using `rfc822Names` or `otherNames` of `type id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox` in the subjectAltName extension or in Subordinate CA Certificates via `rfc822Names` in permittedSubtrees within the Name Constraints extension.

The CA's CP/CPS SHALL specify the procedures that the CA employs to perform this verification. CAs SHALL maintain a record of which domain validation method, including the relevant version number from the Baseline Requirements or S/MIME Baseline Requirements, used to validate every domain or email address in issued Certificates.

Completed validations of Applicant authority may be valid for the issuance of multiple Certificates over time. In all cases, the validation SHALL have been initiated within the time period specified in the relevant requirement (such as [Section 4.2.1](#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions)) prior to Certificate issuance.

#### 3.2.2.1  Validating authority over mailbox via domain

The CA may confirm the Applicant, such as an Enterprise RA, has been authorized by the email account holder to act on the account holder’s behalf by verifying the entity's control over the domain portion of the email address to be used in the Certificate.

The CA SHALL use only the approved methods in Section 3.2.2.4 of the TLS Baseline Requirements to perform this verification.

For purposes of domain validation, the term Applicant includes the Applicant's Parent Company, Subsidiary Company, or Affiliate.

#### 3.2.2.2  Validating control over mailbox via email

The CA may confirm the Applicant's control over each `rfc822Name` or `otherName` of type `id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox` to be included in a Certificate by sending a Random Value via email and then receiving a confirming response utilizing the Random Value. 

Control over each email address SHALL be confirmed using a unique Random Value. The Random Value SHALL be sent only to the email address being validated and SHALL not be shared in any other way. 

The Random Value SHALL be unique in each email. The Random Value SHALL remain valid for use in a confirming response for no more than 24 hours from its creation. The CA MAY specify a shorter validity period for Random Values in its CP and/or CPS.  

The Random Value SHALL be reset upon each instance of the email sent by the CA and, if intended for additional use as an authentication factor, upon first use.  

#### 3.2.2.3  CAA Records

This version of the S/MIME Baseline Requirements does not require the CA to check for CAA records.  The CAA property tags for issue, issuewild, and iodef as specified in RFC 8659 are not recognized for the issuance of S/MIME Certificates.

### 3.2.3  Authentication of organization identity

The following requirements must be fulfilled to authenticate Organization identity included in the `organization-validated` and `sponsor-validated` Certificate types.

#### 3.2.3.1 Verification Requirements – Overview

The CA MUST implement verification processes to confirm and document the following requirements associated with the `subject:organizationName` attribute:

1. Verify Applicant's existence and identity, including;

   A.  Verify the Applicant's legal existence and identity;

   B.  Verify the Applicant's physical existence (business presence at a physical address); and

   C.  Verify the Applicant's operational existence (business activity).

2. Verify a reliable means of communication with the entity to be named as the Subject in the Certificate;

3. Verify the Applicant's authorization for the S/MIME Certificate, including;

   A.  Verify the name, title, and authority of the Contract Signer, Certificate Approver, and Certificate Requester,

   B.  Verify that a Contract Signer signed the Subscriber Agreement or that a duly authorized Applicant Representative acknowledged and agreed to the Terms of Use; and

   C.  Verify that a Certificate Approver has signed or otherwise approved the S/MIME Certificate Request.

As a general rule, the CA is responsible for taking all verification steps reasonably necessary to satisfy each of the Verification Requirements set forth in the subsections below.  The Acceptable Methods of Verification set forth in each of Sections XX through XX (which usually include alternatives) are considered to be the minimum acceptable level of verification required of the CA.  In all cases, however, the CA is responsible for taking any additional verification steps that may be reasonably necessary under the circumstances to satisfy the applicable Verification Requirement.

##### 3.2.3.1.1 Disclosure of Verification Sources

Prior to the use of an Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency to fulfill these verification requirements, the CA MUST publicly disclose Agency Information about the Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency. This disclosure SHALL be through an appropriate and readily accessible online means.

This Agency Information SHALL include at least the following:

* Sufficient information to unambiguously identify the Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency (such as a name, jurisdiction, and website); 
* The accepted value or values for each of the `subject:jurisdictionLocalityName` (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.1), `subject:jurisdictionStateOrProvinceName` (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.2), and `subject:jurisdictionCountryName` (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3) fields, when a certificate is issued using information from that Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency, indicating the jurisdiction(s) that the Agency is appropriate for; 
* The acceptable form or syntax of Registration Numbers used by the Incorporating Agency or Registration Agency, if the CA restricts such Numbers to an acceptable form or syntax; and
* A revision history that includes a unique version number and date of publication for any additions, modifications, and/or removals from this list.

5. The CA obtains evidence that the validation of domain authorization or mailbox control for any email address in the Certificate should not be relied upon.

The CA SHOULD revoke a certificate within 24 hours and MUST revoke a Certificate within 5 days if one or more of the following occurs:

1. The Certificate no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and [Section 6.1.6](#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);
2. The CA obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused;
3. The CA is made aware that a Subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use;
4. The CA is made aware of any circumstance indicating that use of a Fully-Qualified Domain Name in the Certificate is no longer legally permitted (e.g. a court or arbitrator has revoked a Domain Name Registrant's right to use the Domain Name, a relevant licensing or services agreement between the Domain Name Registrant and the Applicant has terminated, or the Domain Name Registrant has failed to renew the Domain Name);
5. The CA is made aware of a material change in the information contained in the Certificate;
6. The CA is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with these Requirements or the CA's CP and/or CPS;
7. The CA determines or is made aware that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate;
8. The CA's right to issue Certificates under these Requirements expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository;
9.  Revocation is required by the CA's CP and/or CPS; or
10. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Subscriber's Private Key to compromise or if there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed.

#### 4.9.1.2 Reasons for Revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate
The Issuing CA SHALL revoke a Subordinate CA Certificate within seven (7) days if one or more of the following occurs:

1. The Subordinate CA requests revocation in writing;
2. The Subordinate CA notifies the Issuing CA that the original Certificate Request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization;
3. The Issuing CA obtains evidence that the Subordinate CA's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise or no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and [Section 6.1.6](#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);

9. Revocation is required by the Issuing CA's CP and/or CPS.
### 4.9.2  Who can request revocation
The Subscriber, RA, or Issuing CA can initiate revocation. Additionally, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties may submit Certificate Problem Reports informing the issuing CA of reasonable cause to revoke the certificate.

### 4.9.3  Procedure for revocation request
The CA SHALL provide a process for Subscribers to request revocation of their own Certificates. The process MUST be described in the CA's CP and/or CPS. The CA SHALL maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports.

The CA SHALL provide Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties with clear instructions for reporting suspected Private Key Compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA SHALL publicly disclose the instructions through a readily accessible online means and in Section 1.5.2 of their CPS.

### 4.9.4  Revocation request grace period
No stipulation.

### 4.9.5  Time within which CA must process the revocation request
Within 24 hours after receiving a Certificate Problem Report, the CA SHALL investigate the facts and circumstances related to a Certificate Problem Report and provide a preliminary report on its findings to both the Subscriber and the entity who filed the Certificate Problem Report.

After reviewing the facts and circumstances, the CA SHALL work with the Subscriber and any entity reporting the Certificate Problem Report or other revocation-related notice to establish whether or not the certificate will be revoked, and if so, a date which the CA will revoke the certificate. The period from receipt of the Certificate Problem Report or revocation-related notice to published revocation MUST NOT exceed the time frame set forth in [Section 4.9.1.1](#4911-reasons-for-revoking-a-subscriber-certificate). The date selected by the CA SHOULD consider the following criteria:

1. The nature of the alleged problem (scope, context, severity, magnitude, risk of harm);
2. The consequences of revocation (direct and collateral impacts to Subscribers and Relying Parties);
3. The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;
4. The entity making the complaint (for example, a complaint from a law enforcement official that a Web site is engaged in illegal activities should carry more weight than a complaint from a consumer alleging that they didn't receive the goods they ordered); and
5. Relevant legislation.
   
### 4.9.6  Revocation checking requirement for relying parties
No stipulation.

**Note**: Following certificate issuance, a certificate may be revoked for reasons stated in [Section 4.9](#49-certificate-revocation-and-suspension). Therefore, relying parties should check the revocation status of all certificates that contain a CDP or OCSP pointer.

### 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency
For the status of Subscriber Certificates: if the CA publishes a CRL, then the CA SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least once every seven days, and the value of the `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than ten days beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates: the CA SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least:

1. once every twelve months; and
2. within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.

The value of the `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than twelve months beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

### 4.9.8 Maximum latency for CRLs
No stipulation.

### 4.9.9  On-line revocation/status checking availability
OCSP responses MUST conform to RFC6960 and/or RFC5019. OCSP responses MUST either:

1. Be signed by the CA that issued the Certificates whose revocation status is being checked, or
2. Be signed by an OCSP Responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA that issued the Certificate whose revocation status is being checked.
   
In the latter case, the OCSP signing Certificate MUST contain an extension of type `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck`, as defined by RFC6960.

### 4.9.10 On-line revocation checking requirements
OCSP responders operated by the CA SHALL support the HTTP GET method, as described in RFC 6960 and/or RFC 5019.

The validity interval of an OCSP response is the difference in time between the thisUpdate and nextUpdate field, inclusive. For purposes of computing differences, a difference of 3,600 seconds shall be equal to one hour, and a difference of 86,400 seconds shall be equal to one day, ignoring leap-seconds.

For the status of Subscriber Certificates:

1. OCSP responses MUST have a validity interval greater than or equal to eight hours;
2. OCSP responses MUST have a validity interval less than or equal to ten days;
3. For OCSP responses with validity intervals less than sixteen hours, then the CA SHALL update the information provided via an Online Certificate Status Protocol prior to one-half of the validity period before the nextUpdate; and
4. For OCSP responses with validity intervals greater than or equal to sixteen hours, then the CA SHALL update the information provided via an Online Certificate Status Protocol at least eight hours prior to the nextUpdate, and no later than four days after the thisUpdate.
   
For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates, the CA SHALL update information provided via OCSP:

1. at least every twelve months; and
2. within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.

If the OCSP responder receives a request for the status of a certificate serial number that is "unused", then the responder SHOULD NOT respond with a "good" status. If the OCSP responder is for a CA that is not Technically Constrained in line with [Section 7.1.5](#715-name-constraints), the responder MUST NOT respond with a "good" status for such requests.

The CA SHOULD monitor the OCSP responder for requests for "unused" serial numbers as part of its security response procedures.

A certificate serial number within an OCSP request is one of the following three options:

1. "assigned" if a Certificate with that serial number has been issued by the Issuing CA, using any current or previous key associated with that CA subject; or
2. "reserved" if a Precertificate [RFC6962] with that serial number has been issued by 
   i. the Issuing CA; or 
   ii. a Precertificate Signing Certificate [RFC6962] associated with the Issuing CA; or
3. "unused" if neither of the previous conditions are met.

### 4.9.11 Other forms of revocation advertisements available
No stipulation.

### 4.9.12 Special requirements re key compromise

For other CA Key Pairs that are for the operator of the Root CA or an Affiliate of the Root CA, the CA SHOULD:

1. prepare and follow a Key Generation Script and
2. have a Qualified Auditor witness the CA Key Pair generation process or record a video of the entire CA Key Pair generation process.

In all cases, the CA SHALL:

1. generate the CA Key Pair in a physically secured environment as described in the CA's CP and/or CPS;
2. generate the CA Key Pair using personnel in Trusted Roles under the principles of multiple person control and split knowledge;
3. generate the CA Key Pair within cryptographic modules meeting the applicable technical and business requirements as disclosed in the CA's CP and/or CPS;
4. log its CA Key Pair generation activities; and
5. maintain effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that the Private Key was generated and protected in conformance with the procedures described in its CP and/or CPS and (if applicable) its Key Generation Script.

#### 6.1.1.2 RA Key Pair Generation

#### 6.1.1.3 Subscriber Key Pair Generation

The CA SHALL reject a Certificate Request if one or more of the following conditions are met:

1. The Key Pair does not meet the requirements set forth in [Section 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and/or [Section 6.1.6](#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);
2. There is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed;
3. The CA is aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Applicant's Private Key to compromise;
4. The CA has previously been made aware that the Applicant's Private Key has suffered a Key Compromise, such as through the provisions of [Section 4.9.1.1](#4911-reasons-for-revoking-a-subscriber-certificate);
5. The CA is aware of a demonstrated or proven method to easily compute the Applicant's Private Key based on the Public Key (such as a Debian weak key, see <https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys>).

### 6.1.2  Private key delivery to subscriber
Parties other than the Subscriber SHALL NOT archive the Subscriber Private Key without authorization by the Subscriber.

If the CA or any of its designated RAs become aware that a Subscriber's Private Key has been communicated to a person or organization not authorized by the Subscriber, then the CA SHALL revoke all certificates that include the Public Key corresponding to the communicated Private Key.

### 6.1.3  Public key delivery to certificate issuer

### 6.1.4  CA public key delivery to relying parties

### 6.1.5  Key sizes

* Ensure that the key represents a valid point on the NIST P-256, NIST P-384 or NIST P-521 elliptic curve.

For EdDSA key pairs, the CA SHALL:

* Ensure that the key represents a valid point on the curve25519 or curve 448 elliptic curve.
  
No other algorithms or key sizes are permitted.

### 6.1.6  Public key parameters generation and quality checking

For RSA key pairs: the CA SHALL confirm that the value of the public exponent is an odd number equal to 3 or more. Additionally, the public exponent SHOULD be in the range between 2^16 + 1 and 2^256 - 1. The modulus SHOULD also have the following characteristics: an odd number, not the power of a prime, and have no factors smaller than 752. [Source: Section 5.3.3, NIST SP 800-89]

For ECDSA key pairs: the CA SHOULD confirm the validity of all keys using either the ECC Full Public Key Validation Routine or the ECC Partial Public Key Validation Routine. [Source: Sections 5.6.2.3.2 and 5.6.2.3.3, respectively, of NIST SP 800-56A: Revision 2]

### 6.1.7  Key usage purposes (as per X.509 v3 key usage field)

CAs SHALL generate non-sequential Certificate serial numbers greater than zero (0) containing at least 64 bits of output from a CSPRNG.

### 7.1.1 Version number(s)

Certificates MUST be of type X.509 v3.

### 7.1.2 Certificate Content and Extensions; Application of RFC 6818

This section specifies the additional requirements for Certificate content and extensions for Certificates.

#### 7.1.2.1 Root CA Certificate

a. `basicConstraints` (MUST be present)

   This extension MUST be marked critical. The `cA` field MUST be set true. The `pathLenConstraint` field SHOULD NOT be present.

b. `keyUsage` (MUST be present)

   This extension MUST be marked critical. Bit positions for `keyCertSign` and `cRLSign` MUST be set. If the Root CA Private Key is used for signing OCSP responses, then the `digitalSignature` bit MUST be set.

c. `certificatePolicies` (SHOULD NOT be present)

   This extension SHOULD NOT be present.

d. `extKeyUsage` (MUST NOT be present)

   This extension MUST NOT be present.

#### 7.1.2.2 Subordinate CA Certificate

a. `certificatePolicies` (MUST be present)

   This extension SHOULD NOT be marked critical.

   If the value of this extension includes a `PolicyInformation` which contains a qualifier of type `id-qt-cps` (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.2.1), then the value of the qualifier MUST be a HTTP or HTTPS URL for the Issuing CA's CP and/or CPS, Relying Party Agreement, or other pointer to online policy information provided by the Issuing CA.

b. `cRLDistributionPoints` (MUST be present)

   This extension MUST be present and MUST NOT be marked critical. It MUST contain the HTTP URL of the CA's CRL service.

c. `authorityInformationAccess` (SHOULD be present)

   This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.

   It SHOULD contain the HTTP URL of the Issuing CA's certificate (`accessMethod` = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.2).
   It MAY contain the HTTP URL of the Issuing CA's OCSP responder (`accessMethod` = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1).

d. `basicConstraints` (MUST be present)

   This extension MUST be marked critical. The `cA` field MUST be set true. The `pathLenConstraint` field MAY be present.

e. `keyUsage` (MUST be present)

   This extension MUST be marked critical. Bit positions for `keyCertSign` and `cRLSign` MUST be set. If the Subordinate CA Private Key is used for signing OCSP responses, then the `digitalSignature` bit MUST be set.

f. `nameConstraints` (MAY be present)

   This extension SHOULD be marked critical[^*].

[^*]: Non-critical Name Constraints are an exception to RFC 5280 (4.2.1.10), however, they MAY be used until the Name Constraints extension is supported by Application Software Suppliers whose software is used by a substantial portion of Relying Parties worldwide.

g. `extKeyUsage` (MAY be present for Cross Certificates; MUST be present otherwise)

   For Cross Certificates that share a Subject Distinguished Name and Subject Public Key with a Root Certificate operated in accordance with these Requirements, this extension MAY be present. If present, this extension SHOULD NOT be marked critical. This extension MUST only contain usages for which the issuing CA has verified the Cross Certificate is authorized to assert. This extension MUST NOT contain the `anyExtendedKeyUsage` [RFC5280] usage.

   For all other Subordinate CA Certificates, including Technically Constrained Subordinate CA Certificates:

   This extension MUST be present and SHOULD NOT be marked critical[^**].

   For Subordinate CA Certificates that will be used to issue S/MIME certificates, the value `id-kp-emailProtection` [RFC5280] MUST be present. The values `id-kp-serverAuth` [RFC5280], `id-kp-codeSigning` [RFC5280], `id-kp-timeStamping` [RFC5280], and `anyExtendedKeyUsage` [RFC5280] MUST NOT be present. Other values MAY be present.

[^**]: While RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.12, notes that this extension will generally only appear within end-entity certificates, these Requirements make use of this extension to further protect relying parties by limiting the scope of subordinate certificates, as implemented by a number of Application Software Suppliers.

h. `authorityKeyIdentifier` (MUST be present)

   This extension MUST be present and MUST NOT be marked critical. It MUST contain a `keyIdentifier` field and it MUST NOT contain a `authorityCertIssuer` or `authorityCertSerialNumber` field.

#### 7.1.2.4 All Certificates

All fields and extensions MUST be set in accordance with RFC 5280. The CA SHALL NOT issue a Certificate that contains a `keyUsage` flag, `extKeyUsage` value, Certificate extension, or other data not specified in [Section 7.1.2.1](#7121-root-ca-certificate), [Section 7.1.2.2](#7122-subordinate-ca-certificate), or [Section 7.1.2.3](#7123--subscriber-certificates) unless the CA is aware of a reason for including the data in the Certificate.

CAs SHALL NOT issue a Certificate with:

1. Extensions that do not apply in the context of the public Internet (such as an extKeyUsage value for a service that is only valid in the context of a privately managed network), unless:<br>
   i. such value falls within an OID arc for which the Applicant demonstrates ownership, or<br>
   ii. the Applicant can otherwise demonstrate the right to assert the data in a public context; or
2. semantics that, if included, will mislead a Relying Party about the certificate information verified by the CA (such as including an `extKeyUsage` value for a smart card, where the CA is not able to verify that the corresponding Private Key is confined to such hardware due to remote issuance).

#### 7.1.4.3 Subject Information - Root Certificates and Subordinate CA Certificates

By issuing a Subordinate CA Certificate, the CA represents that it followed the procedure set forth in its CP and/or CPS to verify that, as of the Certificate's issuance date, all of the Subject Information was accurate.

##### 7.1.4.3.1 Subject Distinguished Name Fields

a. __Certificate Field:__ `subject:commonName` (OID 2.5.4.3)  
   __Required/Optional:__ Required  
   __Contents:__ This field MUST be present and the contents SHOULD be an identifier for the certificate such that the certificate's Name is unique across all certificates issued by the issuing certificate.

b. __Certificate Field:__ `subject:organizationName` (OID 2.5.4.10)  
   __Required/Optional:__ Required  
   __Contents:__ This field MUST be present and the contents MUST contain either the Subject CA's name or DBA as verified under [Section 3.2.2.2](#3222-dbatradename). The CA may include information in this field that differs slightly from the verified name, such as common variations or abbreviations, provided that the CA documents the difference and any abbreviations used are locally accepted abbreviations; e.g., if the official record shows "Company Name Incorporated", the CA MAY use "Company Name Inc." or "Company Name".

c. __Certificate Field:__ `subject:countryName` (OID: 2.5.4.6)  
   __Required/Optional:__ Required  
   __Contents:__ This field MUST contain the two‐letter ISO 3166‐1 country code for the country in which the CA's place of business is located.

d. Other Subject Attributes  
   Other attributes MAY be present within the subject field. If present, other attributes MUST contain information that has been verified by the CA.

### 7.1.5  Name constraints

For a Subordinate CA Certificate to be considered Technically Constrained, the certificate MUST include an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension specifying all extended key usages that the Subordinate CA Certificate is authorized to issue certificates for. The `anyExtendedKeyUsage` KeyPurposeId MUST NOT appear within this extension.

If the Subordinate CA Certificate includes the `id-kp-emailProtection` extended key usage, then the Subordinate CA Certificate MUST include the Name Constraints X.509v3 extension with constraints on `rfc822Name` and `directoryName` as follows:

   1. For each `rfc822Name` in `permittedSubtrees`, each `rfc822Name` MUST contain either a FQDN or a U+002E FULL STOP (".") character followed by a FQDN. The `rfc822Name` MUST NOT contain an email address. The CA MUST confirm that the Applicant has registered the FQDN contained in the `rfc822Name` or has been authorized by the domain registrant to act on the registrant's behalf in line with the verification practices of [Section 3.2.2.4](#3224-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control).

   2. For each `directoryName` in `permittedSubtrees`, the CA MUST confirm the Applicant's and/or Subsidiary's Organizational name and location such that end entity certificates issued from the subordinate CA Certificate will be in compliance with [Section 7.1.2.4](#7124-all-certificates).

### 7.1.6 Certificate policy object identifier

This section describes the content requirements for the Root CA, Subordinate CA, and Subscriber Certificates, as they relate to the identification of Certificate Policy.

#### 7.1.6.1 Reserved Certificate Policy Identifiers

The following Certificate Policy identifiers are reserved for use by CAs to assert that a Certificate complies with these Requirements.

#### 7.1.6.2 Root CA Certificates

A Root CA Certificate SHOULD NOT contain the `certificatePolicies` extension. If present, the extension MUST conform to the requirements set forth for Certificates issued to Subordinate CAs in [Section 7.1.6.3](#7163-subordinate-ca-certificates).

#### 7.1.6.3 Subordinate CA Certificates

A Certificate issued to a Subordinate CA that is not an Affiliate of the Issuing CA:

1. MUST include one or more explicit policy identifiers defined in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) that indicate the Subordinate CA's adherence to and compliance with these Requirements and MAY contain one or more identifiers documented by the Subordinate CA in its CP and/or CPS; and
2. MUST NOT contain the `anyPolicy` identifier (2.5.29.32.0).

A Certificate issued to a Subordinate CA that is an affiliate of the Issuing CA MUST include a set of policy identifiers from one of the two options below:

1. MUST include one or more explicit policy identifiers defined in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) that indicate the Subordinate CA's adherence to and compliance with these Requirements and MAY contain one or more identifiers documented by the Subordinate CA in its CP and/or CPS; or
2. MUST contain the `anyPolicy` identifier (2.5.29.32.0).

The Subordinate CA and the Issuing CA SHALL represent, in their CP and/or CPS, that all Certificates containing a policy identifier indicating compliance with these Requirements are issued and managed in accordance with these Requirements.

#### 7.1.6.4 Subscriber Certificates

A Certificate issued to a Subscriber MUST contain, within the Certificate's `certificatePolicies` extension, a policy identifier that is specified in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers).

The certificate MAY also contain additional policy identifier(s) defined by the Issuing CA. The issuing CA SHALL document in its CP and/or CPS that the Certificates it issues containing the specified policy identifier(s) are managed in accordance with these requirements.

### 7.1.7  Usage of Policy Constraints extension

### 7.1.8  Policy qualifiers syntax and semantics

### 7.1.9 Processing semantics for the critical Certificate Policies extension

## 7.2  CRL profile

### 7.2.1  Version number(s)

### 7.2.2  CRL and CRL entry extensions

## 7.3  OCSP profile

### 7.3.1  Version number(s)

### 7.3.2  OCSP extensions

# 8. COMPLIANCE AUDIT AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS
The CA SHALL at all times:

1. Issue Certificates and operate its PKI in accordance with all law applicable to its business and the Certificates it issues in every jurisdiction in which it operates;
2. Comply with these Requirements;
3. Comply with the audit requirements set forth in this section; and
4. Be licensed as a CA in each jurisdiction where it operates, if licensing is required by the law of such jurisdiction for the issuance of Certificates.

**Implementers' Note**: The CA/Browser Forum continues to improve the S/MIME Baseline Requirements while WebTrust and ETSI also continue to update their audit criteria. We encourage all CAs to conform to each revision herein on the date specified without awaiting a corresponding update to an applicable audit criterion. In the event of a conflict between an existing audit criterion and a guideline revision, we will communicate with the audit community and attempt to resolve any uncertainty, and we will respond to implementation questions directed to <questions@cabforum.org>. 
## 8.1  Frequency or circumstances of assessment
Certificates that are capable of being used to issue new certificates MUST either be Technically Constrained in line with [Section 7.1.5](#715-name-constraints) and audited in line with [Section 8.8](#88-review-of-enterprise-ra-or-technically-constrained-subordinate-ca) only, or Unconstrained and fully audited in line with all remaining requirements from this section. A Certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new certificates if it contains an X.509v3 `basicConstraints` extension, with the `cA` boolean set to true and is therefore by definition a Root CA Certificate or a Subordinate CA Certificate.

The period during which the CA issues Certificates SHALL be divided into an unbroken sequence of audit periods. An audit period MUST NOT exceed one year in duration.

If the CA has a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with an audit scheme listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then no pre-issuance readiness assessment is necessary.

If the CA does not have a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then, before issuing Publicly-Trusted Certificates, the CA SHALL successfully complete a point-in-time readiness assessment performed in accordance with applicable standards under one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment). The point-in-time readiness assessment SHALL be completed no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing Publicly-Trusted Certificates and SHALL be followed by a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first Publicly-Trusted Certificate.

## 8.2  Identity/qualifications of assessor
The CA's audit SHALL be performed by a Qualified Auditor. A Qualified Auditor means a natural person, Legal Entity, or group of natural persons or Legal Entities that collectively possess the following qualifications and skills:

1. Independence from the subject of the audit;
2. The ability to conduct an audit that addresses the criteria specified in an Eligible Audit Scheme (see [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment));
3. Employs individuals who have proficiency in examining Public Key Infrastructure technology, information security tools and techniques, information technology and security auditing, and the third-party attestation function;
4. (For audits conducted in accordance with any one of the ETSI standards) accredited in accordance with ISO 17065 applying the requirements specified in ETSI EN 319 403;
5. (For audits conducted in accordance with the WebTrust standard) licensed by WebTrust;
6. Bound by law, government regulation, or professional code of ethics; and
7. Except in the case of an Internal Government Auditing Agency, maintains Professional Liability/Errors & Omissions insurance with policy limits of at least one million US dollars in coverage.
   
## 8.3  Assessor's relationship to assessed entity

## 8.4  Topics covered by assessment
The CA SHALL undergo an audit in accordance with one of the following schemes:

1. “WebTrust for CAs v2.1 or newer” AND “XXXX or newer”; or
2. ETSI EN 319 411-1 v1.2.2 or newer, which includes normative references to ETSI EN 319 401 (the latest version of the referenced ETSI documents should be applied); or
3. If a Government CA is required by its Certificate Policy to use a different internal audit scheme, it MAY use such scheme provided that the audit either
   a. encompasses all requirements of one of the above schemes or
   b. consists of comparable criteria that are available for public review.
Whichever scheme is chosen, it MUST incorporate periodic monitoring and/or accountability procedures to ensure that its audits continue to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the scheme.

The audit MUST be conducted by a Qualified Auditor, as specified in [Section 8.2](#82-identityqualifications-of-assessor).

For Delegated Third Parties which are not Enterprise RAs, then the CA SHALL obtain an audit report, issued under the auditing standards that underlie the accepted audit schemes found in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), that provides an opinion whether the Delegated Third Party's performance complies with either the Delegated Third Party's practice statement or the CA's CP and/or CPS. If the opinion is that the Delegated Third Party does not comply, then the CA SHALL not allow the Delegated Third Party to continue performing delegated functions.

The audit period for the Delegated Third Party SHALL NOT exceed one year (ideally aligned with the CA's audit). However, if the CA or Delegated Third Party is under the operation, control, or supervision of a Government Entity and the audit scheme is completed over multiple years, then the annual audit MUST cover at least the core controls that are required to be audited annually by such scheme plus that portion of all non-core controls that are allowed to be conducted less frequently, but in no case may any non-core control be audited less often than once every three years.

## 8.5  Actions taken as a result of deficiency

## 8.6  Communication of results
The Audit Report SHALL state explicitly that it covers the relevant systems and processes used in the issuance of all Certificates that assert one or more of the policy identifiers listed in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers). The CA SHALL make the Audit Report publicly available.

The CA MUST make its Audit Report publicly available no later than three months after the end of the audit period. In the event of a delay greater than three months, the CA SHALL provide an explanatory letter signed by the Qualified Auditor.

The Audit Report MUST contain at least the following clearly-labelled information:

1. Name of the organization being audited;
2. Name and address of the organization performing the audit;
3. The SHA-256 fingerprint of all Roots and Subordinate CA Certificates, including Cross Certificates, that were in-scope of the audit;
4. Audit criteria, with version number(s), that were used to audit each of the certificates (and associated keys);
5. A list of the CA policy documents, with version numbers, referenced during the audit;
6. Whether the audit assessed a period of time or a point in time;
7. The start date and end date of the Audit Period, for those that cover a period of time;
8. The point in time date, for those that are for a point in time;
9. The date the report was issued, which will necessarily be after the end date or point in time date; 
10. (For audits conducted in accordance with any of the ETSI standards) a statement to indicate if the audit was a full audit or a surveillance audit, and which portions of the criteria were applied and evaluated, e.g., ETSI EN 319 401, ETSI EN 319 411-1 policy LCP, NCP or NCP+, ETSI EN 319 411-2 policy QCP-n, QCP-n-qscd, QCP-l or QCP-l-qscd; and
11. (For audits conducted in accordance with any of the ETSI standards) a statement to indicate that the auditor referenced the applicable CA/Browser Forum criteria, such as this document, and the version used.

An authoritative English language version of the publicly available audit information MUST be provided by the Qualified Auditor and the CA SHALL ensure it is publicly available.

The Audit Report MUST be available as a PDF, and SHALL be text searchable for all information required. Each SHA-256 fingerprint within the Audit Report MUST be uppercase letters and MUST NOT contain colons, spaces, or line feeds.

## 8.7 Self Audits

During the period in which the CA issues Certificates, the CA SHALL monitor adherence to its CP and/or CPS and these Requirements and strictly control its service quality by performing self audits on at least a quarterly basis against a randomly selected sample of the greater of one certificate or at least three percent of the Certificates issued by it during the period commencing immediately after the previous self-audit sample was taken. 

## 8.8 Review of Enterprise RA or Technically Constrained Subordinate CA

Except for Delegated Third Parties that undergo an annual audit that meets the criteria specified in [Section 8.4](#84--topics-covered-by-assessment), the CA SHALL ensure the practices and procedures of each Delegated Third Party, Enterprise RA, and Technically Constrained Subordinate CA are in compliance with these Requirements and the relevant CP and/or CPS,

The CA SHALL internally audit the compliance of Delegated Third Parties, Enterprise RAs, and Technically Constrained Subordinate CAs with these Requirements on an annual basis, and SHALL include having a Validation Specialist employed by the CA perform ongoing quarterly audits against a randomly selected sample of at least the greater of one certificate or three percent of the Certificates verified or issued by those parties in the period beginning immediately after the last sample was taken.

For delegated tasks, the CA and any Delegated Third Party MAY allocate liability between themselves contractually as they determine, but the CA SHALL remain fully responsible for the performance of all parties in accordance with these Requirements, as if the tasks had not been delegated.

If the CA has issued and managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its CP and/or CPS, the CA MAY disclaim liability to the Certificate Beneficiaries or any other third parties for any losses suffered as a result of use or reliance on such Certificate beyond those specified in the CA's CP and/or CPS. If the CA has not issued or managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its CP and/or CPS, the CA MAY seek to limit its liability to the Subscriber and to Relying Parties, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved, for any and all claims, losses or damages suffered as a result of the use or reliance on such Certificate by any appropriate means that the CA desires. If the CA chooses to limit its liability for Certificates that are not issued or managed in compliance with these Requirements or its CP and/or CPS, then the CA SHALL include the limitations on liability in the CA's CP and/or CPS.

## 9.9  Indemnities
Notwithstanding any limitations on its liability to Subscribers and Relying Parties, the CA understands and acknowledges that the Application Software Suppliers who have a Root Certificate distribution agreement in place with the Root CA do not assume any obligation or potential liability of the CA under these Requirements or that otherwise might exist because of the issuance or maintenance of Certificates or reliance thereon by Relying Parties or others. Thus, except in the case where the CA is a government entity, the CA SHALL defend, indemnify, and hold harmless each Application Software Supplier for any and all claims, damages, and losses suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved. This does not apply, however, to any claim, damages, or loss suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA where such claim, damage, or loss was directly caused by such Application Software Supplier's software displaying as not trustworthy a Certificate that is still valid, or displaying as trustworthy: (1) a Certificate that has expired, or (2) a Certificate that has been revoked (but only in cases where the revocation status is currently available from the CA online, and the application software either failed to check such status or ignored an indication of revoked status).

In the event of a conflict between these Requirements and a law, regulation or government order (hereinafter ‘Law’) of any jurisdiction in which a CA operates or issues certificates, a CA MAY modify any conflicting requirement to the minimum extent necessary to make the requirement valid and legal in the jurisdiction. This applies only to operations or certificate issuances that are subject to that Law. In such event, the CA SHALL immediately (and prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) include in Section 9.16.3 of the CA’s CPS a detailed reference to the Law requiring a modification of these Requirements under this section, and the specific modification to these Requirements implemented by the CA.

The CA SHALL also (prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) notify the CA/Browser Forum of the relevant information newly added to its CPS by sending a message to questions@cabforum.org and receiving confirmation that it has been posted to the Public Mailing List and is indexed in the Public Mail Archives available at [https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/](https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/) (or such other email addresses and links as the Forum may designate), so that the CA/Browser Forum may consider possible revisions to these Requirements accordingly.

Any modification to CA practice enabled under this section SHALL be discontinued if and when the Law no longer applies, or these Requirements are modified to make it possible to comply with both them and the Law simultaneously. An appropriate change in practice, modification to the CA’s CPS and a notice to the CA/Browser Forum, as outlined above, SHALL be made within 90 days.

### 9.16.4  Enforcement (attorneys' fees and waiver of rights)

### 9.16.5  Force Majeure

## 9.17  Other provisions

## A.1 Reference Sources

### A.1.1 Qualified Independent Information Source

A Qualified Independent Information Source (QIIS) is a regularly-updated and publicly available database that is generally recognized as a dependable source for certain information.  A database qualifies as a QIIS if the CA determines that:

1. Industries other than the certificate industry rely on the database for accurate location, contact, or other information; and

2. The database provider updates its data on at least an annual basis.

The CA SHALL use a documented process to check the accuracy of the database and ensure its data is acceptable, including reviewing the database provider's terms of use. The CA SHALL NOT use any data in a QIIS that the CA knows is

  i. self-reported and
  ii. not verified by the QIIS as accurate.

Databases in which the CA or its owners or affiliated companies maintain a controlling interest, or in which any Registration Authorities or subcontractors to whom the CA has outsourced any portion of the vetting process (or their owners or affiliated companies) maintain any ownership or beneficial interest, do not qualify as a QIIS.

## A.2 CAA Methods

### A.2.1 CAA contactemail Property

SYNTAX: `contactemail <rfc6532emailaddress>`

The CAA contactemail property takes an email address as its parameter. The entire parameter value MUST be a valid email address as defined in RFC 6532, Section 3.2, with no additional padding or structure, or it cannot be used.

The following is an example where the holder of the domain specified the contact property using an email address.

```DNS Zone
$ORIGIN example.com.
               CAA 0 contactemail "domainowner@example.com"
```

The contactemail property MAY be critical, if the domain owner does not want CAs who do not understand it to issue certificates for the domain.

### A.2.2 CAA contactphone Property

SYNTAX: `contactphone <rfc3966 Global Number>`

The CAA contactphone property takes a phone number as its parameter. The entire parameter value MUST be a valid Global Number as defined in RFC 3966, Section 5.1.4, or it cannot be used. Global Numbers MUST have a preceding + and a country code and MAY contain visual separators.

The following is an example where the holder of the domain specified the contact property using a phone number.

```DNS Zone
$ORIGIN example.com.
               CAA 0 contactphone "+1 (555) 123-4567"
```

The contactphone property MAY be critical if the domain owner does not want CAs who do not understand it to issue certificates for the domain.
