# 1.  INTRODUCTION

**This is a pre-release draft of the S/MIME Baseline Requirements (SBR) and is undergoing active editing.  It has not yet been balloted to to become a CA/Browser Forum standard.**
## 1.1  Overview
This document describes an integrated set of technologies, protocols, identity-proofing, lifecycle management, and auditing requirements that are necessary for the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates.

**Notice for Readers**

An S/MIME Certificate contains a public key bound to an email address, and may also contain the identity of a natural person or legal entity that controls such email address. The key pair can then be used to sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt email. An S/MIME Certificate can be identified by the existence of an Extended Key Usage (EKU) Object Identifier (OID) of 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4 for `emailProtection`.

The CP for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates describes a subset of the requirements that a Certification Authority must meet in order to issue Publicly Trusted S/MIME Certificates. This document serves two purposes: to specify Baseline Requirements and to provide guidance and requirements for what a CA should include in its CPS. Except where explicitly stated otherwise, these Requirements apply only to relevant events that occur on or after DATE (the original effective date of these requirements).

These Requirements do not address all of the issues relevant to the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates. In accordance with RFC 3647 and to facilitate a comparison of other certificate policies and CPSs (e.g. for policy mapping), this document includes all sections of the RFC 3647 framework. However, rather than beginning with a “no stipulation” comment in all empty sections, the CA/Browser Forum initially leaves sections blank until a decision of “no stipulation” is made. The CA/Browser Forum may update these Requirements from time to time.

These Requirements do not address the issuance or management of Certificates by enterprises that operate their own Public Key Infrastructure for internal purposes only, and for which the Root Certificate is not distributed by any Application Software Supplier. These Requirements are applicable to all Certification Authorities within a chain of trust. They are to be flowed down from the Root Certification Authority through successive Subordinate Certification Authorities.

## 1.2  Document name and identification
This Certificate Policy (CP) contains the requirements for the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates, as adopted by the CA/Browser Forum.

The following Certificate Policy identifiers are reserved for use by CAs as a means of asserting compliance with this document (OID arc 2.23.140.1.5.x.y) as follows:

`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) smime-baseline(5)}`

## 1.3  PKI participants
The CA/Browser Forum is a voluntary organization of Certification Authorities and suppliers of Internet browser and other relying-party software applications including mail user agents (web-based or application based) and email service providers that process S/MIME Certificates.
### 1.3.1  Certification authorities
Certification Authority (CA) is defined in Section 1.6.1. Current CA Members of the CA/Browser Forum are listed here: https://cabforum.org/members.
### 1.3.2  Registration authorities
With the exception of sections __, the CA MAY delegate the performance of all, or any part, of Section 3.2 requirements to a Delegated Third Party, provided that the process as a whole fulfills all of the requirements of Section 3.2.

Before the CA authorizes a Delegated Third Party to perform a delegated function, the CA SHALL contractually require the Delegated Third Party to:

1. Meet the qualification requirements of Section 5.3.1, when applicable to the delegated function;
2. Retain documentation in accordance with Section 5.5.2;
3. Abide by the other provisions of these Requirements that are applicable to the delegated function; and
4. Comply with (a) the CA's Certificate Policy/Certification Practice Statement or (b) the Delegated Third Party's practice statement that the CA has verified complies with these Requirements.

The CA MAY designate an Enterprise RA to verify certificate requests from the Enterprise RA's own organization.  The CA SHALL NOT accept certificate requests authorized by an Enterprise RA unless the following requirements are satisfied:

1. The CA SHALL confirm that the requested Fully-Qualified Domain Name(s) are within the Enterprise RA's verified Domain Namespace.
2. If the certificate request includes a Subject name of a type other than a Fully-Qualified Domain Name, the CA SHALL confirm that the name is either that of the delegated enterprise, or an Affiliate of the delegated enterprise, or that the delegated enterprise is an agent of the named Subject. For example, the CA SHALL NOT issue a Certificate containing the Subject name "XYZ Co." on the authority of Enterprise RA "ABC Co.", unless the two companies are affiliated (see Section 3.2) or "ABC Co." is the agent of "XYZ Co". This requirement applies regardless of whether the accompanying requested Subject FQDN falls within the Domain Namespace of ABC Co.'s Registered Domain Name.

The CA SHALL impose these limitations as a contractual requirement on the Enterprise RA and monitor compliance by the Enterprise RA.
### 1.3.3  Subscribers
As defined in Section 1.6.1.
### 1.3.4 Relying parties
“Relying Party” and “Application Software Supplier” are defined in Section 1.6.1. Current Members of the CA/Browser Forum who are Application Software Suppliers are listed here: https://cabforum.org/members.
### 1.3.5  Other participants
Other groups that have participated in the development of these Requirements include the AICPA/CICA WebTrust for Certification Authorities task force and the Accredited Conformity Assessment Bodies' Council (ACAB'c). Participation by such groups does not imply their endorsement, recommendation, or approval of the final product.
## 1.4  Certificate usage
The primary goal of these Requirements is to provide a framework where “reasonable assurance” may be provided to senders and recipients of email messages that the party identified in an S/MIME Certificate has control of the domain or email address being asserted. A variation of this use case is where an individual or organization digitally signs email to establish its authenticity and source of origin.  
### 1.4.1  Appropriate certificate uses
The primary goal of these Requirements is to describe an integrated set of technologies, protocols, identity-proofing, lifecycle management, and auditing requirements for the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates. These Requirements also serve to inform users and help them to make informed decisions when relying on Certificates.
### 1.4.2 Prohibited certificate uses
No stipulation.
## 1.5  Policy administration
This document may be revised from time to time, as appropriate, in accordance with procedures adopted by the CA/Browser Forum.  The CA/Browser Forum welcomes recommendations and suggestions regarding this standard by email at questions@cabforum.org. 
### 1.5.1  Organization administering the document
No stipulation.
### 1.5.2  Contact person
Contact information for the CA/Browser Forum is available here: https://cabforum.org/leadership/. In this section of a CA’s CPS, the CA shall provide a link to a web page or an email address for contacting the person or persons responsible for operation of the CA, including contact information for entities wishing to submit a Certificate Problem Report.
### 1.5.3  Person determining CPS suitability for the policy
No stipulation.
### 1.5.4  CPS approval procedures
No stipulation.

# 2. PUBLICATION AND REPOSITORY RESPONSIBILITIES
The CA SHALL develop, implement, enforce, and annually update a Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement that describes in detail how the CA implements the latest version of these Requirements.
## 2.1  Repositories
The CA SHALL make revocation information for Subordinate CA Certificates and Subscriber Certificates available in accordance with this Policy.
## 2.2  Publication of certification information
The CA SHALL publicly disclose its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement through an appropriate and readily accessible online means that is available on a 24x7 basis. The CA SHALL publicly disclose its CA business practices to the extent required by the CA's selected audit scheme (see Section 8.1).

The Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement SHALL be structured in accordance with RFC 3647 and SHALL include all material required by RFC 3647.

The CA SHALL publicly give effect to these Requirements and represent that it will adhere to the latest published version. The CA MAY fulfill this requirement by incorporating these Requirements directly into its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statements or by incorporating them by reference using a clause such as the following (which SHALL include a link to the official version of these Requirements):

> [Name of CA] conforms to the current version of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates published at http://www.cabforum.org. In the event of any inconsistency between this document and those Requirements, those Requirements take precedence over this document.

#### 3.2.2.2  Validation of domain authorization or control
This section defines the permitted processes and procedures for confirming the Applicant's control of the email addresses to be included in issued Certificates. 

The CA SHALL verify that Applicant controls the email accounts associated with all email addresses referenced in the Certificate or has been authorized by the email account holder to act on the account holder’s behalf. 

<b>Note:</b> Email addresses may be listed in Subscriber Certificates using Rfc822Names in the subjectAltName extension or in Subordinate CA Certificates via Rfc822Names in permittedSubtrees within the Name Constraints extension.

The CA's CP/CPS SHALL specify the procedures that the CA employs to perform this verification. CAs SHALL maintain a record of which domain validation method, including the relevant version number from the Baseline Requirements or S/MIME Baseline Requirements, used to validate every domain or email address in issued Certificates.

Completed validations of Applicant authority may be valid for the issuance of multiple Certificates over time. In all cases, the validation SHALL have been initiated within the time period specified in the relevant requirement (such as Section 4.2.1 of this document) prior to Certificate issuance.
##### 3.2.2.2.1  Validating authority over email address via domain
Confirming the Applicant has been authorized by the email account holder to act on the account holder’s behalf by verifying the entity's control over the domain portion of the email address to be used in the Certificate.

The CA SHALL use only the approved methods in Section 3.2.2.4 of Version 1.7.3 of the Baseline Requirements to perform this verification.

The CA SHALL NOT delegate validation of the domain portion of an email address. 

For purposes of domain validation, the term Applicant includes the Applicant's Parent Company, Subsidiary Company, or Affiliate.
##### 3.2.2.2.2  Validating control over email address via email
Confirming the Applicant's control over the rfc822Name email address by sending a Random Value via email and then receiving a confirming response utilizing the Random Value. The Random Value SHALL be sent only to the email address being validated and SHALL not be shared in any other way. 

The Random Value SHALL be unique in each email. 

The CA MAY resend the email in its entirety, including re-use of the Random Value, provided that the entire contents and recipient email address of the communication remain unchanged.

The Random Value SHALL remain valid for use in a confirming response for no more than 30 days from its creation. The CPS MAY specify a shorter validity period for Random Values, in which case the CA SHALL follow its CPS.

It shall clearly specify the set of Issuer Domain Names that the CA recognizes in CAA "issue" or "issuewild" records as permitting it to issue. The CA SHALL log all actions taken, if any, consistent with its processing practice.</u>
### 4.2.1 Performing identification and authentication functions
Applicant information SHALL include, but not be limited to, at least one rfc822Name email address to be included in the Certificate's subjectAltName extension.

Section 6.3.2 limits the validity period of Subscriber Certificates. The CA MAY use the documents and data provided in Section 3.2 to verify certificate information, or may reuse previous validations themselves, provided that the CA obtained the data or document from a source specified under Section 3.2 or completed the validation itself no more than 398 days prior to issuing the Certificate.

In no case may a prior validation be reused if any data or document used in the prior validation was obtained more than the maximum time permitted for reuse of the data or document prior to issuing the Certificate.

After the change to any validation method specified in the Baseline Requirements or EV Guidelines, a CA may continue to reuse validation data or documents collected prior to the change, or the validation itself, for the period stated in this BR 4.2.1 unless otherwise specifically provided in a ballot.

### 4.9.1  Circumstances for revocation

#### 4.9.1.1 Reasons for Revoking a Subscriber Certificate
The CA SHALL revoke a Certificate within 24 hours if one or more of the following occurs:
1. The Subscriber requests in writing that the CA revoke the Certificate;
2. The Subscriber notifies the CA that the original certificate request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization;
3. The CA obtains evidence that the Subscriber's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise;
4. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that can easily compute the Subscriber's Private Key based on the Public Key in the Certificate (such as a Debian weak key, see <https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys>);
5. The CA obtains evidence that the validation of domain authorization or mailbox control for any email address in the Certificate should not be relied upon.

The CA SHOULD revoke a certificate within 24 hours and MUST revoke a Certificate within 5 days if one or more of the following occurs:
1. The Certificate no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and [Section 6.1.6](#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);
2. The CA obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused;
3. The CA is made aware that a Subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use;
4. The CA is made aware of any circumstance indicating that use of a Fully-Qualified Domain Name in the Certificate is no longer legally permitted (e.g. a court or arbitrator has revoked a Domain Name Registrant's right to use the Domain Name, a relevant licensing or services agreement between the Domain Name Registrant and the Applicant has terminated, or the Domain Name Registrant has failed to renew the Domain Name);
5. The CA is made aware of a material change in the information contained in the Certificate;
6. The CA is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with these Requirements or the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement;
7. The CA determines or is made aware that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate;
8. The CA's right to issue Certificates under these Requirements expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository;
9.  Revocation is required by the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement; or
10. The CA is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Subscriber's Private Key to compromise or if there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed.
#### 4.9.1.2 Reasons for Revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate
The Issuing CA SHALL revoke a Subordinate CA Certificate within seven (7) days if one or more of the following occurs:
1. The Subordinate CA requests revocation in writing;
2. The Subordinate CA notifies the Issuing CA that the original certificate request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization;
3. The Issuing CA obtains evidence that the Subordinate CA's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise or no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5](#615-key-sizes) and [Section 6.1.6](#616-public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);
4. The Issuing CA obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused;
5. The Issuing CA is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with or that Subordinate CA has not complied with this document or the applicable Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement;
6. The Issuing CA determines that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate or misleading;
7. The Issuing CA or Subordinate CA ceases operations for any reason and has not made arrangements for another CA to provide revocation support for the Certificate;
8. The Issuing CA's or Subordinate CA's right to issue Certificates under these Requirements expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the Issuing CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository; or
9. Revocation is required by the Issuing CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement.
### 4.9.2  Who can request revocation
The Subscriber, RA, or Issuing CA can initiate revocation. Additionally, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties may submit Certificate Problem Reports informing the issuing CA of reasonable cause to revoke the certificate.
### 4.9.3  Procedure for revocation request
The CA SHALL provide a process for Subscribers to request revocation of their own Certificates. The process MUST be described in the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement. The CA SHALL maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports.

The CA SHALL provide Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties with clear instructions for reporting suspected Private Key Compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA SHALL publicly disclose the instructions through a readily accessible online means and in Section 1.5.2 of their CPS.
### 4.9.4  Revocation request grace period
No stipulation.

### 4.9.5  Time within which CA must process the revocation request
Within 24 hours after receiving a Certificate Problem Report, the CA SHALL investigate the facts and circumstances related to a Certificate Problem Report and provide a preliminary report on its findings to both the Subscriber and the entity who filed the Certificate Problem Report.
After reviewing the facts and circumstances, the CA SHALL work with the Subscriber and any entity reporting the Certificate Problem Report or other revocation-related notice to establish whether or not the certificate will be revoked, and if so, a date which the CA will revoke the certificate. The period from receipt of the Certificate Problem Report or revocation-related notice to published revocation MUST NOT exceed the time frame set forth in [Section 4.9.1.1](#4911-reasons-for-revoking-a-subscriber-certificate). The date selected by the CA SHOULD consider the following criteria:
1. The nature of the alleged problem (scope, context, severity, magnitude, risk of harm);
2. The consequences of revocation (direct and collateral impacts to Subscribers and Relying Parties);
3. The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;
4. The entity making the complaint (for example, a complaint from a law enforcement official that a Web site is engaged in illegal activities should carry more weight than a complaint from a consumer alleging that they didn't receive the goods they ordered); and
5. Relevant legislation.
### 4.9.6  Revocation checking requirement for relying parties
No stipulation.

**Note**: Following certificate issuance, a certificate may be revoked for reasons stated in [Section 4.9](#49-certificate-revocation-and-suspension). Therefore, relying parties should check the revocation status of all certificates that contain a CDP or OCSP pointer.
### 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency
For the status of Subscriber Certificates:
If the CA publishes a CRL, then the CA SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least once every seven days, and the value of the `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than ten days beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.
For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates:
The CA SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least:
  i. once every twelve months; and
  ii. within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.
The value of the `nextUpdate` field MUST NOT be more than twelve months beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.
### 4.9.8 Maximum latency for CRLs
No stipulation.
### 4.9.9  On-line revocation/status checking availability
OCSP responses MUST conform to RFC6960 and/or RFC5019. OCSP responses MUST either:
1. Be signed by the CA that issued the Certificates whose revocation status is being checked, or
2. Be signed by an OCSP Responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA that issued the Certificate whose
revocation status is being checked.
In the latter case, the OCSP signing Certificate MUST contain an extension of type `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck`, as
defined by RFC6960.

# 8. COMPLIANCE AUDIT AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS
The CA SHALL at all times:

1. Issue Certificates and operate its PKI in accordance with all law applicable to its business and the Certificates it issues in every jurisdiction in which it operates;
2. Comply with these Requirements;
3. Comply with the audit requirements set forth in this section; and
4. Be licensed as a CA in each jurisdiction where it operates, if licensing is required by the law of such jurisdiction for the issuance of Certificates.

**Implementers' Note**: The CA/Browser Forum continues to improve the S/MIME Baseline Requirements while WebTrust and ETSI also continue to update their audit criteria. We encourage all CAs to conform to each revision herein on the date specified without awaiting a corresponding update to an applicable audit criterion. In the event of a conflict between an existing audit criterion and a guideline revision, we will communicate with the audit community and attempt to resolve any uncertainty, and we will respond to implementation questions directed to <questions@cabforum.org>. 
## 8.1  Frequency or circumstances of assessment
Certificates that are capable of being used to issue new certificates MUST either be Technically Constrained in line with [Section 7.1.5](#715-name-constraints) and audited in line with [Section 8.7](#87-self-audits) only, or Unconstrained and fully audited in line with all remaining requirements from this section. A Certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new certificates if it contains an X.509v3 `basicConstraints` extension, with the `cA` boolean set to true and is therefore by definition a Root CA Certificate or a Subordinate CA Certificate.

The period during which the CA issues Certificates SHALL be divided into an unbroken sequence of audit periods. An audit period MUST NOT exceed one year in duration.

If the CA has a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with an audit scheme listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then no pre-issuance readiness assessment is necessary.

If the CA does not have a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then, before issuing Publicly-Trusted Certificates, the CA SHALL successfully complete a point-in-time readiness assessment performed in accordance with applicable standards under one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment). The point-in-time readiness assessment SHALL be completed no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing Publicly-Trusted Certificates and SHALL be followed by a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first Publicly-Trusted Certificate.

## 8.2  Identity/qualifications of assessor
The CA's audit SHALL be performed by a Qualified Auditor. A Qualified Auditor means a natural person, Legal Entity, or group of natural persons or Legal Entities that collectively possess the following qualifications and skills:

1. Independence from the subject of the audit;
2. The ability to conduct an audit that addresses the criteria specified in an Eligible Audit Scheme (see [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment));
3. Employs individuals who have proficiency in examining Public Key Infrastructure technology, information security tools and techniques, information technology and security auditing, and the third-party attestation function;
4. (For audits conducted in accordance with any one of the ETSI standards) accredited in accordance with ISO 17065 applying the requirements specified in ETSI EN 319 403;
5. (For audits conducted in accordance with the WebTrust standard) licensed by WebTrust;
6. Bound by law, government regulation, or professional code of ethics; and
7. Except in the case of an Internal Government Auditing Agency, maintains Professional Liability/Errors & Omissions insurance with policy limits of at least one million US dollars in coverage.
## 8.3  Assessor's relationship to assessed entity

## 8.4  Topics covered by assessment
The CA SHALL undergo an audit in accordance with one of the following schemes:

1. “WebTrust for CAs v2.1 or newer” AND “XXXX or newer”; or
2. ETSI EN 319 411-1 v1.2.2 or newer, which includes normative references to ETSI EN 319 401 (the latest version of the referenced ETSI documents should be applied); or
3. If a Government CA is required by its Certificate Policy to use a different internal audit scheme, it MAY use such scheme provided that the audit either
   a. encompasses all requirements of one of the above schemes or
   b. consists of comparable criteria that are available for public review.
Whichever scheme is chosen, it MUST incorporate periodic monitoring and/or accountability procedures to ensure that its audits continue to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the scheme.

The audit MUST be conducted by a Qualified Auditor, as specified in [Section 8.2](#82-identityqualifications-of-assessor).

For Delegated Third Parties which are not Enterprise RAs, then the CA SHALL obtain an audit report, issued under the auditing standards that underlie the accepted audit schemes found in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), that provides an opinion whether the Delegated Third Party's performance complies with either the Delegated Third Party's practice statement or the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. If the opinion is that the Delegated Third Party does not comply, then the CA SHALL not allow the Delegated Third Party to continue performing delegated functions.

The audit period for the Delegated Third Party SHALL NOT exceed one year (ideally aligned with the CA's audit). However, if the CA or Delegated Third Party is under the operation, control, or supervision of a Government Entity and the audit scheme is completed over multiple years, then the annual audit MUST cover at least the core controls that are required to be audited annually by such scheme plus that portion of all non-core controls that are allowed to be conducted less frequently, but in no case may any non-core control be audited less often than once every three years.
## 8.5  Actions taken as a result of deficiency

## 8.6  Communication of results
The Audit Report SHALL state explicitly that it covers the relevant systems and processes used in the issuance of all Certificates that assert one or more of the policy identifiers listed in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers). The CA SHALL make the Audit Report publicly available.

The CA MUST make its Audit Report publicly available no later than three months after the end of the audit period. In the event of a delay greater than three months, the CA SHALL provide an explanatory letter signed by the Qualified Auditor.

The Audit Report MUST contain at least the following clearly-labelled information:

1. Name of the organization being audited;
2. Name and address of the organization performing the audit;
3. The SHA-256 fingerprint of all Roots and Subordinate CA Certificates, including Cross Certificates, that were in-scope of the audit;
4. Audit criteria, with version number(s), that were used to audit each of the certificates (and associated keys);
5. A list of the CA policy documents, with version numbers, referenced during the audit;
6. Whether the audit assessed a period of time or a point in time;
7. The start date and end date of the Audit Period, for those that cover a period of time;
8. The point in time date, for those that are for a point in time;
9. The date the report was issued, which will necessarily be after the end date or point in time date; 
10. (For audits conducted in accordance with any of the ETSI standards) a statement to indicate if the audit was a full audit or a surveillance audit, and which portions of the criteria were applied and evaluated, e.g., ETSI EN 319 401, ETSI EN 319 411-1 policy LCP, NCP or NCP+, ETSI EN 319 411-2 policy QCP-n, QCP-n-qscd, QCP-l or QCP-l-qscd; and
11. (For audits conducted in accordance with any of the ETSI standards) a statement to indicate that the auditor referenced the applicable CA/Browser Forum criteria, such as this document, and the version used.

An authoritative English language version of the publicly available audit information MUST be provided by the Qualified Auditor and the CA SHALL ensure it is publicly available.

The Audit Report MUST be available as a PDF, and SHALL be text searchable for all information required. Each SHA-256 fingerprint within the Audit Report MUST be uppercase letters and MUST NOT contain colons, spaces, or line feeds.

## 8.7 Review of Enterprise RA or Technically Constrained Subordinate CA

The CA SHALL review the practices and procedures of each Enterprise RA or Technically Constrained Subordinate CA to ensure that each such entity is in compliance with these Requirements and the relevant Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement.

The CA SHALL internally audit the compliance of each Enterprise RA or Technically Constrained Subordinate CA with these Requirements on an annual basis.

## 9.8  Limitations of liability
For delegated tasks, the CA and any Delegated Third Party MAY allocate liability between themselves contractually as they determine, but the CA SHALL remain fully responsible for the performance of all parties in accordance with these Requirements, as if the tasks had not been delegated.

If the CA has issued and managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, the CA MAY disclaim liability to the Certificate Beneficiaries or any other third parties for any losses suffered as a result of use or reliance on such Certificate beyond those specified in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement. If the CA has not issued or managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, the CA MAY seek to limit its liability to the Subscriber and to Relying Parties, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved, for any and all claims, losses or damages suffered as a result of the use or reliance on such Certificate by any appropriate means that the CA desires. If the CA chooses to limit its liability for Certificates that are not issued or managed in compliance with these Requirements or its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement, then the CA SHALL include the limitations on liability in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement.
## 9.9  Indemnities
Notwithstanding any limitations on its liability to Subscribers and Relying Parties, the CA understands and acknowledges that the Application Software Suppliers who have a Root Certificate distribution agreement in place with the Root CA do not assume any obligation or potential liability of the CA under these Requirements or that otherwise might exist because of the issuance or maintenance of Certificates or reliance thereon by Relying Parties or others. Thus, except in the case where the CA is a government entity, the CA SHALL defend, indemnify, and hold harmless each Application Software Supplier for any and all claims, damages, and losses suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved. This does not apply, however, to any claim, damages, or loss suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA where such claim, damage, or loss was directly caused by such Application Software Supplier's software displaying as not trustworthy a Certificate that is still valid, or displaying as trustworthy: (1) a Certificate that has expired, or (2) a Certificate that has been revoked (but only in cases where the revocation status is currently available from the CA online, and the application software either failed to check such status or ignored an indication of revoked status).

### 9.16.3  Severability

In the event of a conflict between these Requirements and a law, regulation or government order (hereinafter ‘Law’) of any jurisdiction in which a CA operates or issues certificates, a CA MAY modify any conflicting requirement to the minimum extent necessary to make the requirement valid and legal in the jurisdiction. This applies only to operations or certificate issuances that are subject to that Law. In such event, the CA SHALL immediately (and prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) include in Section 9.16.3 of the CA’s CPS a detailed reference to the Law requiring a modification of these Requirements under this section, and the specific modification to these Requirements implemented by the CA.

The CA SHALL also (prior to issuing a certificate under the modified requirement) notify the CA/Browser Forum of the relevant information newly added to its CPS by sending a message to questions@cabforum.org and receiving confirmation that it has been posted to the Public Mailing List and is indexed in the Public Mail Archives available at https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/ (or such other email addresses and links as the Forum may designate), so that the CA/Browser Forum may consider possible revisions to these Requirements accordingly.

Any modification to CA practice enabled under this section SHALL be discontinued if and when the Law no longer applies, or these Requirements are modified to make it possible to comply with both them and the Law simultaneously. An appropriate change in practice, modification to the CA’s CPS and a notice to the CA/Browser Forum, as outlined above, SHALL be made within 90 days.
