# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Overview

This S/MIME Baseline Requirements document describes an integrated set of technologies, protocols, identity-proofing, lifecycle management, and auditing requirements that are necessary for the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates.

An S/MIME Certificate for the purposes of this document can be identified by the existence of an Extended Key Usage (EKU) for `id-kp-emailProtection` (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4) and the inclusion of a `rfc822Name` or an `otherName` of type `id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox` in the `subjectAltName` extension.

**Notice for Readers**

An S/MIME Certificate contains a Public Key bound to a Mailbox Address and MAY also contain the identity of a Natural Person or Legal Entity that controls such email address. The Key Pair can then be used to sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt email. 

This Certificate Policy (CP) describes a subset of the requirements that a CA SHALL meet in order to issue Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates. This document serves two purposes: to specify Baseline Requirements and to provide guidance and requirements for what a Certification Authority (CA) should include in its Certification Practice Statement (CPS). These Requirements apply only to relevant events that occur on or after the relevant Effective Date described in [Section 1.2.1](#121-revisions) of these Requirements.

These Requirements do not address all of the issues relevant to the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates. To facilitate a comparison of other CP and/or CPS (e.g., for policy mapping), this document includes all sections of the [RFC 3647](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3647) framework. The CA/Browser Forum MAY update these Requirements from time to time.

These Requirements do not address the issuance or management of Certificates by enterprises that operate their own Public Key Infrastructure for internal purposes only, and for which the Root CA Certificate is not distributed by any Application Software Supplier. 

These Requirements are applicable to all CAs within a Publicly-Trusted chain of trust. They are to be flowed down from the Root CA through successive Subordinate CAs.

## 1.2 Document name and identification

This Certificate Policy contains the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates, as adopted by the CA/Browser Forum.

These Requirements describe four Certificate profiles differentiated by the type of Subject:

| Certificate Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Mailbox-validated | Subject is limited to (optional) `subject:emailAddress`, `subject:commonName`, and/or `subject:serialNumber` attributes. |
| Organization-validated | Includes only Organizational (Legal Entity) attributes in the Subject. |
| Sponsor-validated | Combines Individual (Natural Person) attributes in conjunction with a `subject:organizationName` (an associated Legal Entity) attribute. Registration for Sponsor-validated Certificates MAY be performed by an Enterprise RA.|
| Individual-validated | Includes only Individual (Natural Person) attributes in the Subject. |

In addition, Generations (known as Legacy, Multipurpose, and Strict) are specified for each of these Certificate Types, acknowledging both the current diversity of practice in issuing S/MIME Certificates as well as the desire to move towards more closely-defined practices over time.

The following Certificate Policy identifiers are reserved for use by CAs as a means of asserting compliance with this document (OID arc 2.23.140.1.5) as follows:

**Mailbox-validated**  
`{joint-iso-itu-t(2) international-organizations(23) ca-browser-forum(140) certificate-policies(1) smime-baseline(5) mailbox-validated (1) legacy (1)}` (2.23.140.1.5.1.1); and

## 1.3 PKI participants

The CA/Browser Forum is a voluntary organization of Certification Authorities and Application Software Suppliers including providers of Internet browser and other relying-party software applications, such as mail user agents (web-based or application-based) and email service providers that process S/MIME Certificates.

### 1.3.1 Certification authorities

Certification Authority (CA) is defined in [Section 1.6.1](#161-definitions). Current CA Members of the CA/Browser Forum are listed at https://cabforum.org/members.

### 1.3.2 Registration authorities

With the exception of [Section 3.2.2](#322-validation-of-mailbox-authorization-or-control), the CA MAY delegate the performance of all, or any part, of [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) requirements to a Delegated Third Party, provided that the process as a whole fulfills all of the requirements of [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation).

Before the CA authorizes a Delegated Third Party to perform a delegated function, the CA SHALL contractually require the Delegated Third Party to:

1. Meet the qualification requirements of [Section 5.3.1](#531-qualifications-experience-and-clearance-requirements), when applicable to the delegated function;
2. Retain documentation in accordance with [Section 5.5.2](#552-retention-period-for-archive);
3. Abide by the other provisions of these Requirements that are applicable to the delegated function; and
4. Comply with (a) the CA's CP and/or CPS or (b) the Delegated Third Party's practice statement that the CA has verified complies with these Requirements.

#### 1.3.2.1 Enterprise registration authorities

The CA MAY delegate to an Enterprise Registration Authority (RA) to verify Certificate Requests for Subjects within the Enterprise RA's own organization. The CA SHALL NOT accept Certificate Requests authorized by an Enterprise RA unless the following requirements are satisfied:

1. If the Certificate Request is for a `Mailbox-validated`, `Organization-validated`, or `Sponsor-validated` profile, the CA SHALL confirm that the Enterprise RA has authorization or control of the requested email domain(s) in accordance with [Section 3.2.2.1](#3221-validating-authority-over-mailbox-via-domain) or [Section 3.2.2.3](#3223-validating-applicant-as-operator-of-associated-mail-servers). 
2. The CA SHALL confirm that the `subject:organizationName` name is either that of the delegated enterprise, or an Affiliate of the delegated enterprise, or that the delegated enterprise is an agent of the named Subject. For example, the CA SHALL NOT issue a Certificate containing the Subject name "XYZ Co." on the authority of Enterprise RA "ABC Co.", unless the two companies are Affiliated as defined in [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) or "ABC Co." is the agent of "XYZ Co". This requirement applies regardless of whether the accompanying requested email domain falls within the subdomains of ABC Co.'s Registered Domain Name.

The CA SHALL impose these limitations as a contractual requirement on the Enterprise RA and monitor compliance by the Enterprise RA in accordance with [Section 8.8](#88-review-of-delegated-parties).

An Enterprise RA MAY also submit Certificate Requests using the `Mailbox-validated` profile for users whose email domain(s) are not under the delegated organization’s authorization or control.  In this case, the CA SHALL confirm that the mailbox holder has control of the requested Mailbox Address(es) in accordance with [Section 3.2.2.2](#3222-validating-control-over-mailbox-via-email).


### 1.3.3 Subscribers

As defined in [Section 1.6.1](#161-definitions).

### 1.3.4 Relying parties

“Relying Party” and “Application Software Supplier” are defined in [Section 1.6.1](161-definitions). Current Members of the CA/Browser Forum who are Application Software Suppliers are listed at https://cabforum.org/members.

### 1.3.5 Other participants

Other groups that have participated in the development of these Requirements include the CPA Canada WebTrust for Certification Authorities task force and the Accredited Conformity Assessment Bodies’ Council (ACAB’C). Participation by these groups does not imply their endorsement, recommendation, or approval of the final product.

## 1.4 Certificate usage

The primary goal of these Requirements is to provide a framework of “reasonable assurance” to senders and recipients of email messages that the Subject identified in an S/MIME Certificate has control of the domain or Mailbox Address being asserted. A variation of this use case is where an Individual or organization digitally signs email to establish its authenticity and source of origin. 

### 1.4.1 Appropriate certificate uses

These Requirements describe an integrated set of technologies, protocols, identity-proofing, lifecycle management, and auditing requirements for the issuance and management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates. These Requirements also serve to inform users and help them to make informed decisions when relying on Certificates.

### 1.4.2 Prohibited certificate uses

No stipulation.

## 1.5 Policy administration

These Requirements MAY be revised from time to time, as appropriate, in accordance with procedures adopted by the CA/Browser Forum. The CA/Browser Forum welcomes recommendations and suggestions regarding this standard by email at <questions@cabforum.org>. 

### 1.5.1 Organization administering the document

No stipulation.

### 1.5.2 Contact person

Contact information for the CA/Browser Forum is available at https://cabforum.org/leadership/. In this section of a CA’s CPS, the CA SHALL provide a link to a web page or an email address for contacting the person or persons responsible for operation of the CA, including contact information for entities wishing to submit a Certificate Problem Report or revocation request.

### 1.5.3 Person determining CPS suitability for the policy

No stipulation.

### 1.5.4 CPS approval procedures

No stipulation.

## 1.6 Definitions and acronyms

**Extant S/MIME CA**: A Subordinate CA that:

   1. Is a Publicly-Trusted Subordinate CA Certificate whose `notBefore` field is before September 1, 2023 and which is included in a valid trust chain of an end entity S/MIME Certificate;
   2. The CA Certificate includes no Extended Key Usage extension, contains `anyExtendedKeyUsage` in the EKU extension, or contains `id-kp-emailProtection` in the EKU extension; 
   3. The CA Certificate complies with the profile defined in [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280). The following two deviations from the [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280) profile are acceptable:
      a. The CA Certificate contains a `nameConstraints` extension that is not marked critical; 
      b. The CA Certificate contains a policy qualifier of type UserNotice which contains `explicitText` that uses an encoding that is not permitted by [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280) (i.e., the `DisplayText` is encoded using BMPString or VisibleString); and
   4. The CA Certificate contains the `anyPolicy` identifier (2.5.29.32.0) or specific OIDs in the `certificatePolicies` extension that do not include those defined in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers) of these Requirements.

**Fully-Qualified Domain Name**: A Domain Name that includes the Domain Labels of all superior nodes in the Internet Domain Name System.

**Generation**: The S/MIME Baseline Requirements define several Generations of Certificate Profile for each Certificate Type.

**Individual**: A Natural Person.

**Individual-Validated**: Refers to a Certificate Subject that includes only Individual (Natural Person) attributes, rather than attributes linked to an Organization. 

**Issuing CA**: In relation to a particular Certificate, the CA that issued the Certificate. This could be either a Root CA or a Subordinate CA.

**Jurisdiction of Incorporation**: The country and (where applicable) the state or province or locality where the organization's legal existence was established by a filing with (or an act of) an appropriate government agency or entity (e.g., where it was incorporated). In the context of a Government Entity, the country and (where applicable) the state or province where the Entity's legal existence was created by law.

**Key Compromise**: A Private Key is said to be compromised if its value has been disclosed to an unauthorized person, or an unauthorized person has had access to it.

**Key Generation Script**: A documented plan of procedures for the generation of a CA Key Pair.

**Key Pair**: The Private Key and its associated Public Key.

**Legacy Profile**: The S/MIME Legacy Generation profiles provide flexibility for existing reasonable S/MIME certificate practices to become auditable under the S/MIME Baseline Requirements. This includes options for Subject DN attributes, `extKeyUsage`, and other extensions. The Legacy Profiles will be deprecated in a future version of the S/MIME Baseline Requirements.

**Legal Entity**: An association, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, trust, government entity or other entity with legal standing in a country's legal system.

**Mailbox-Validated (MV)**: Refers to a Certificate Subject that is limited to (optional) `subject:emailAddress` and/or `subject:serialNumber` attributes.

**Mailbox Address**: Also Email Address. The format of a Mailbox Address is defined as a "Mailbox" as specified in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC 5321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321) and amended by Section 3.2 of [RFC 6532](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6532), with no additional padding or structure.

**Mailbox Field**: In Subscriber Certificates contains a Mailbox Address of the Subject via `rfc822Name` or `otherName` value of type `id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox` in the `subjectAltName` extension, or in Subordinate CA Certificates via `rfc822Name` in permittedSubtrees within the `nameConstraints` extension.

**Multipurpose Profile**: The S/MIME Multipurpose Generation profiles are aligned with the more defined Strict Profiles, but with additional options for `extKeyUsage` and other extensions. This is intended to allow flexibility for crossover use cases between document signing and secure email. 

**Natural Person**: An Individual; a human being as distinguished from a Legal Entity.

**Object Identifier**: A unique alphanumeric or numeric identifier registered under the International Organization for Standardization's applicable standard for a specific object or object class.

**OCSP Responder**: An online server operated under the authority of the CA and connected to its Repository for processing Certificate status requests. See also, Online Certificate Status Protocol.

**Online Certificate Status Protocol**: An online Certificate-checking protocol that enables relying-party application software to determine the status of an identified Certificate. See also OCSP Responder.

**Organization-Validated**: Refers to a Certificate Subject that includes only Organizational (Legal Entity) attributes, rather than attributes linked to an Individual.

**Parent Company**: A company that Controls a Subsidiary Company.

**Personal Name**: Personal Name is a name of an Individual Subject typically presented as `subject:givenName` and/or `subject:surname`. However, the Personal Name may be in a format preferred by the Subject, the CA, or Enterprise RA as long as it remains a meaningful representation of the Subject’s verified name.

**Physical Identity Document**: a government-issued identity document issued in physical and human-readable form (such as a passport or national identity card).

**Private Key**: The key of a Key Pair that is kept secret by the holder of the Key Pair, and that is used to create Digital Signatures and/or to decrypt electronic records or files that were encrypted with the corresponding Public Key.

**Pseudonym**: A fictitious identity that a person assumes for a particular purpose. Unlike an anonymous identity, a pseudonym can be linked to the person's real identity.

**Public Key**: The key of a Key Pair that can be publicly disclosed by the holder of the corresponding Private Key and that is used by a Relying Party to verify Digital Signatures created with the holder's corresponding Private Key and/or to encrypt messages so that they can be decrypted only with the holder's corresponding Private Key.

**Public Key Infrastructure**: A set of hardware, software, people, procedures, rules, policies, and obligations used to facilitate the trustworthy creation, issuance, management, and use of Certificates and keys based on Public Key Cryptography.

**Publicly-Trusted Certificate**: A Certificate that is trusted by virtue of the fact that its corresponding Root CA Certificate is distributed as a trust anchor in widely-available application software.

**Qualified Auditor**: A Natural Person or Legal Entity that meets the requirements of [Section 8.2](#82-identityqualifications-of-assessor).

**Random Value**: A value specified by a CA to the Applicant that exhibits at least 112 bits of entropy.

**Registered Domain Name**: A Domain Name that has been registered with a Domain Name Registrar.

**Registration Authority (RA)**: Any Legal Entity that is responsible for identification and authentication of subjects of Certificates, but is not a CA, and hence does not sign or issue Certificates. An RA MAY assist in the certificate application process or revocation process or both. When "RA" is used as an adjective to describe a role or function, it does not necessarily imply a separate body, but can be part of the CA.

**Registration Reference**: A unique identifier assigned to a Legal Entity.

**Registration Scheme**: A scheme for assigning a Registration Reference meeting the requirements identified in Appendix A.

**Reliable Data Source**: An identification document or source of data used to verify Subject Identity Information that is generally recognized among commercial enterprises and governments as reliable, and which was created by a third party for a purpose other than the Applicant obtaining a Certificate.

**Reliable Method of Communication**: A method of communication, such as a postal/courier delivery address, telephone number, or email address, that was verified using a source other than the Applicant Representative.

**Relying Party**: Any Natural Person or Legal Entity that relies on a Valid Certificate. An Application Software Supplier is not considered a Relying Party when software distributed by such Supplier merely displays information relating to a Certificate.

**Repository**: An online database containing publicly-disclosed PKI governance documents (such as Certificate Policies and Certification Practice Statements) and Certificate status information, either in the form of a CRL or an OCSP response.

**Requirements**: The S/MIME Baseline Requirements found in this document.

**Sponsor-validated**: Refers to a Certificate Subject which combines Individual (Natural Person) attributes in conjunction with an `subject:organizationName` (an associated Legal Entity) attribute. Registration for Sponsor-validated Certificates MAY be performed by an Enterprise RA where the `subject:organizationName` is either that of the delegated enterprise, or an Affiliate of the delegated enterprise, or that the delegated enterprise is an agent of the named Subject Organization. 

**Strict Profile**: The S/MIME Strict Generation profiles are the long term target profile for S/MIME Certificates with `extKeyUsage` limited to `id-kp-emailProtection`, and stricter use of Subject DN attributes and other extensions.

**Subject**: The Natural Person, device, system, unit, or Legal Entity identified in a Certificate as the Subject. The Subject is either the Subscriber or a mailbox under the control and operation of the Subscriber.

**Subject Identity Information**: Information that identifies the Certificate Subject. Subject Identity Information does not include a Mailbox Address listed in the `subject:commonName` or `subject:emailAddress` fields, or in the `subjectAltName` extension.

**Subordinate CA**: A Certification Authority whose Certificate is signed by the Root CA, or another Subordinate CA.

**Subscriber**: A Natural Person or Legal Entity to whom a Certificate is issued and who is legally bound by a Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use.

**Subscriber Agreement**: An agreement between the CA and the Applicant/Subscriber that specifies the rights and responsibilities of the parties.

**Subsidiary Company**: A company that is controlled by a Parent Company.

**Supplementary Evidence**: Used in addition to authoritative evidence to strengthen the reliability of the identity verification and/or as evidence for attributes that are not evidenced by the authoritative evidence.

**Technically Constrained Subordinate CA Certificate**: A Subordinate CA Certificate which uses a combination of Extended Key Usage settings and Name Constraint settings to limit the scope within which the Subordinate CA Certificate MAY issue Certificates to Subscriber or additional Subordinate CAs.

**Terms of Use**: Provisions regarding the safekeeping and acceptable uses of a Certificate issued in accordance with these Requirements when the Applicant/Subscriber is an Affiliate of the CA or is the CA.

**Valid Certificate**: A Certificate that passes the validation procedure specified in [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280).

**Validation Specialist**: Someone who performs the information verification duties specified by these Requirements.

**Validity Period**: From [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280): "The period of time from notBefore through notAfter, inclusive."

###  1.6.4 Conventions

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in these Requirements shall be interpreted in accordance with [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

# 2. PUBLICATION AND REPOSITORY RESPONSIBILITIES

## 2.1 Repositories

The CA SHALL make revocation information for Subordinate CA Certificates and Subscriber Certificates available in accordance with this Policy.

## 2.2 Publication of certification information

The CA SHALL publicly disclose its CP and/or CPS through an appropriate and readily accessible online means that is available on a 24x7 basis. The CA SHALL publicly disclose its CA business practices to the extent required by the CA's selected audit scheme (see [Section 8](#8-compliance-audit-and-other-assessments)).

The CP and/or CPS SHALL be structured in accordance with [RFC 3647](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3647) and SHALL include all material required by [RFC 3647](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3647).

Starting on September 15, 2024 the CA SHALL state its policy or practice on processing CAA Records for Mailbox Addresses in Section 4.2 of its CP and/or CPS. That policy SHALL be consistent with these Requirements and SHALL clearly specify the set of Issuer Domain Names that the CA recognizes in CAA `issuemail` records as permitting it to issue. 

The CA SHALL publicly give effect to these Requirements and represent that it will adhere to the latest published version. The CA MAY fulfill this requirement by incorporating these Requirements directly into its CP and/or CPS or by incorporating them by reference using a clause such as the following (which SHALL include a link to the official version of these Requirements):

> [Name of CA] conforms to the current version of the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates published at https://www.cabforum.org. In the event of any inconsistency between this document and those Requirements, those Requirements take precedence over this document.

## 2.3 Time or frequency of publication

The CA SHALL develop, implement, enforce, and annually update a Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement (CP and/or CPS) that describes in detail how the CA implements the latest version of these Requirements. The CA SHALL review and update its CP and/or CPS at least every 365 days, incrementing the version number and adding a dated changelog entry, even if no other changes are made to the document.

## 2.4 Access controls on repositories

The CA SHALL make its Repository publicly available in a read-only manner.

# 3. IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

## 3.1 Naming

 No stipulation.

### 3.1.1 Types of names

When the `subject:commonName` of a Certificate issued to an Individual does not contain a Mailbox Address, it is specified as a Personal Name or Pseudonym as described in [Section 7.1.4.2.2](#71422-subject-distinguished-name-fields)(a). 

Names consisting of multiple words are permitted. Given names joined with a hyphen are considered as one single given name. Subjects with more than one given name MAY choose one or several of their given names in any sequence. Subjects MAY choose the order of their given name(s) and surname in accordance with national preference.

The CA MAY allow common variations or abbreviations of Personal Names consistent with local practice. 

### 3.1.2 Need for names to be meaningful

Personal Names SHALL be a meaningful representation of the Subject’s name as verified in the identifying documentation or Enterprise RA records. 

### 3.1.3 Anonymity or pseudonymity of subscribers

The purpose of a Pseudonym is to provide a unique identifier linked to an Individual in a pseudonymized manner when certain privacy conditions are required. For example, a Pseudonym may be used if a government agency requires officials to sign certain decisions via S/MIME so those decisions trace back to individuals, but emphasize the importance of the role over Individual identity in the Certificate. The CA SHALL disclose in its CP and/or CPS if it allows the use of Pseudonyms.

For `Sponsor-validated` certificates, the CA MAY use a `subject:pseudonym` attribute in the Certificate if the associated Subject has been verified according to [Section 3.2.4](#324-authentication-of-individual-identity). If present, the `subject:pseudonym` attribute SHALL be:

  1. either a unique identifier selected by the CA for the Subject of the Certificate; or
  2. an identifier selected by the Enterprise RA which uniquely identifies the Subject of the Certificate within the Organization included in the `subject:organizationName` attribute.

For `Individual-validated` certificates, the CA MAY use the `subject:pseudonym` attribute if the associated Subject has been verified according to [Section 3.2.4](#324-authentication-of-individual-identity). If present, the `subject:pseudonym` attribute SHALL be:

  1. either a unique identifier selected by the CA for the Subject of the Certificate; or
  2. an identifier verified based on government-issued identity documents.

Pseudonym Certificates are not anonymous. CAs and Enterprise RAs SHALL treat Individual identity information relating to a Pseudonym as private in accordance with [Section 9.4.2](#942-information-treated-as-private).

### 3.1.4 Rules for interpreting various name forms

#### 3.1.4.1 Non ASCII character substitution

The CA MAY allow the Conversion of Subject Identity Information usually rendered in non-ASCII characters (including Accent or Umlaut-accented characters) using a system commonly used in the Applicant's Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration, or recognized by the United Nations or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The CA SHOULD state the used Conversion systems in its CP and/or CPS. For example, regardless of capitalization:

*  Accent characters MAY be represented by their ASCII equivalent. For example é, à, í, ñ, or ç MAY be represented by e, a, i, n, or c, respectively.
*  Umlaut-accented characters such as ä, ö, ü MAY be represented by either ae, oe, ue or a, o, u, respectively.

The CA MAY include an ASCII character name that is not a direct Conversion of the Applicant's registered name provided that it is verified in a Reliable Data Source or suitable Attestation.

#### 3.1.4.2 Geographic names

The CA MAY use geographic endonyms and exonyms in the `subject:localityName` and `subject:stateOrProvinceName` attributes, (e.g., Munich, Monaco di Bavaria, or Мюнхен for München). The CA SHOULD avoid the use of archaic geographic names, (e.g., prefer Mumbai over Bombay).

### 3.1.5 Uniqueness of names

No stipulation.

### 3.1.6 Recognition, authentication, and role of trademarks

No stipulation.

## 3.2 Initial identity validation

The CA SHALL authenticate the identity attributes of the Subject and their control over the Mailbox Addresses to be included in the S/MIME Certificate according to the requirements of the following sections:

| Certificate Type    | Mailbox Control | Organization Identity | Individual Identity | 
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| `Mailbox-validated` | [Section 3.2.2](#322-validation-of-mailbox-authorization-or-control)  | NA | NA | 
| `Organization-validated` |  [Section 3.2.2](#322-validation-of-mailbox-authorization-or-control)  | [Section 3.2.3](#323-authentication-of-organization-identity) | NA |
| `Sponsor-validated` | [Section 3.2.2](#322-validation-of-mailbox-authorization-or-control) | [Section 3.2.3](#323-authentication-of-organization-identity) | [Section 3.2.4](#324-authentication-of-individual-identity) | 
| `Individual-validated` | [Section 3.2.2](#322-validation-of-mailbox-authorization-or-control) | NA | [Section 3.2.4](#324-authentication-of-individual-identity) | 

### 3.2.1 Method to prove possession of private key

No stipulation.

### 3.2.2 Validation of mailbox authorization or control

This section defines the permitted processes and procedures for confirming the Applicant's control of Mailbox Addresses to be included in issued Certificates. 

The CA SHALL verify that Applicant controls the email accounts associated with all Mailbox Fields referenced in the Certificate or has been authorized by the email account holder to act on the account holder’s behalf. 

The CA SHALL NOT delegate the verification of mailbox authorization or control.

The CA's CP and/or CPS SHALL specify the procedures that the CA employs to perform this verification. CAs SHALL maintain a record of which validation method, including the relevant version number from the TLS Baseline Requirements or S/MIME Baseline Requirements, was used to validate every domain or email address in issued Certificates.

Completed validations of Applicant authority MAY be valid for the issuance of multiple Certificates over time. In all cases, the validation SHALL have been initiated within the time period specified in the relevant requirement (such as [Section 4.2.1](#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions)) prior to Certificate issuance.

**Note:** Mailbox Fields MAY be listed in Subscriber Certificates using `rfc822Name` or `otherNames` of `type id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox` in the `subjectAltName` extension. Mailbox Fields MAY be listed in Subordinate CA Certificates via `rfc822Name` in permittedSubtrees within the `nameConstraints` extension.

#### 3.2.2.1 Validating authority over mailbox via domain

The CA MAY confirm the Applicant, such as an Enterprise RA, has been authorized by the email account holder to act on the account holder’s behalf by verifying the entity's control over the domain portion of the Mailbox Address to be used in the Certificate.

The CA SHALL use only the approved methods in [Section 3.2.2.4 of the TLS Baseline Requirements](https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/blob/main/docs/BR.md#3224-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control) to perform this verification.

For purposes of domain validation, the term Applicant includes the Applicant's Parent Company, Subsidiary Company, or Affiliate.

#### 3.2.2.2 Validating control over mailbox via email

The CA MAY confirm the Applicant's control over each Mailbox Field to be included in a Certificate by sending a Random Value via email and then receiving a confirming response utilizing the Random Value. 

Control over each Mailbox Address SHALL be confirmed using a unique Random Value. The Random Value SHALL be sent only to the email address being validated and SHALL not be shared in any other way. 

The Random Value SHALL be unique in each email. The Random Value SHALL remain valid for use in a confirming response for no more than 24 hours from its creation. The CA MAY specify a shorter validity period for Random Values in its CP and/or CPS.

The Random Value SHALL be reset upon each instance of the email sent by the CA to a Mailbox Address, however all relevant Random Values sent to that Mailbox Address MAY remain valid for use in a confirming response within the validity period described in this Section. In addition, the Random Value SHALL be reset upon first use by the user if intended for additional use as an authentication factor following the Mailbox Address verification. 

#### 3.2.2.3 Validating applicant as operator of associated mail server(s)

The CA MAY confirm the Applicant's control over each Mailbox Field to be included in the Certificate by confirming control of the SMTP FQDN to which a message delivered to the Mailbox Address should be directed. The SMTP FQDN SHALL be identified using the address resolution algorithm defined in [RFC 5321 Section 5.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321#section-5.1) which determines which SMTP FQDNs are authoritative for a given Mailbox Address. If more than one SMTP FQDN has been discovered, the CA SHALL verify control of an SMTP FQDN following the selection process at [RFC 5321 Section 5.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321#section-5.1). Aliases in MX record RDATA SHALL NOT be used for this validation method.

To confirm the Applicant's control of the SMTP FQDN, the CA SHALL use only the currently-approved methods in [Section 3.2.2.4](https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/blob/main/docs/BR.md#3224-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control) of the TLS Baseline Requirements.

### 3.2.3 Authentication of organization identity

The following requirements SHALL be fulfilled to authenticate Organization identity included in the `Organization-validated` and `Sponsor-validated` profiles.

#### 3.2.3.1 Attribute collection of organization identity

The CA or RA SHALL collect and retain evidence supporting the following identity attributes for the Organization:

1.	Formal name of the Legal Entity;
2.	A registered Assumed Name for the Legal Entity (if included in the Subject);
3. An Affiliate of the Legal Entity as described in Section 7.1.4.2.2 (if included in the Subject as an `subject:organizationalUnitName`);
4.	An address of the Legal Entity (if included in the Subject);
5.	Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Registration of the Legal Entity; and
6.	Unique identifier and type of identifier for the Legal Entity. 

The unique identifier SHALL be included in the Certificate `subject:organizationIdentifier` as specified in [Section 7.1.4.2.2](#71422-subject-distinguished-name-fields) and [Appendix A](#appendix-a---registration-schemes).

#### 3.2.3.2 Validation of organization identity

If an Attestation is used as evidence for the validation of the attributes described in this section, then the Attestation SHALL be verified for authenticity as described in [Section 3.2.8](#328-reliability-of-verification-sources).

##### 3.2.3.2.1 Verification of name, address, and unique identifier

The CA or RA SHALL verify the full legal name and an address (if included in the Certificate Subject) of the Legal Entity Applicant using documentation provided by, or through communication with, at least one of the following:

1.	A government agency in the jurisdiction of the Legal Entity’s creation, existence, or recognition; 
2.	A Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) data reference;
3.	A site visit by the CA or a third party who is acting as an agent for the CA; or
4.	An Attestation which includes a copy of supporting documentation used to establish the Applicant's legal existence (such as a certificate of registration, articles of incorporation, operating agreement, statute, or regulatory act) and its current status.

The CA or RA MAY use the same documentation or communication described in 1 through 4 above to verify both the Applicant's identity and address.

In cases 1 and 4 above, the CA or RA SHALL verify that the status of the Applicant is not designated by labels such as "ceased," "inactive," "invalid," "not current," or the equivalent.

In case 2 above when LEI data reference is used, the CA or RA SHALL verify that the RegistrationStatus is ISSUED and the EntityStatus is ACTIVE. The CA SHALL only allow use of an LEI if the ValidationSources entry is FULLY_CORROBORATED. An LEI SHALL NOT be used if ValidationSources entry is PARTIALLY_CORROBORATED, PENDING, or ENTITY_SUPPLIED_ONLY.

##### 3.2.3.2.2 Verification of assumed name

Applicants MAY request an Assumed Name to be included in the Certificate. The CA or RA SHALL verify that:

1.	The Applicant has registered its use of the Assumed Name with the appropriate government agency for such filings in the jurisdiction of its incorporation or registration; and 
2.	The Assumed Name filing continues to be valid.

The CA MAY rely on an Attestation that indicates the Assumed Name under which the Applicant conducts business, the government agency with which the Assumed Name is registered, and that such filing continues to be valid.

#### 3.2.3.3 Disclosure of verification sources

The CA or RA SHALL verify the unique identifier used in the Certificate from a register that is maintained or authorized by the relevant government agency. The CA SHALL disclose the authorized sources it uses to verify the Applicant's creation, existence, or recognition. This disclosure SHALL be through an appropriate and readily accessible online means. The CA SHALL document where to obtain this information within Section 3.2 of the CA's CP and/or CPS.

Nothing in these Requirements prohibits the use of third-party vendors to obtain regularly-updated and current information from the government register provided that the third party obtains the information directly from the government.

In the case of a LEI data reference, the CA or RA SHALL verify the associated data record with the [Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation](https://search.gleif.org/#/search/).

### 3.2.4 Authentication of individual identity

The following requirements SHALL be fulfilled to authenticate Individual identity attributes included in `Sponsor-validated` and `Individual-validated` Certificate profiles.

The CA, RA, or Enterprise RA SHALL collect and retain evidence supporting the following identity attributes for the Individual Applicant:

1. Given name(s) and surname(s), which SHALL be current names;
2. Pseudonym (if used); 
3. Title (if used);
4. Address (if displayed in Subject); and
5. Further information as needed to uniquely identify the Applicant.

The CA or RA SHALL comply with applicable data protection legislation in the gathering and retention of evidence relating to Individual identity supporting this Requirement in accordance with [Section 9.4](#94-privacy-of-personal-information).

#### 3.2.4.1 Attribute collection of individual identity

The CA SHALL document and publish the methods it uses to collect Individual identity attributes.

1.	**From a physical identity document** 

If physical identity documents are used as evidence, the CA or RA SHALL accept only government-issued passports or identity cards, and other official identity documents of comparable reliability (such as drivers license or military ID). 

The physical identity document used as evidence SHALL contain a face photo and/or other information that can be compared with the Applicant's physical appearance.

The CA SHALL document and publish information describing the physical or digital identity documents or document types it accepts.

2.	**From a digital identity document** 

If digital identity documents (such as passports or national ID cards including a chip bearing digitally signed information about the holder) are used as evidence, the CA or RA SHALL only accept eMRTD digital identity documents according to ICAO 9303 part 10.

This method does not include "eID" as described in Regulation (EU) 910/2014.

3. **Using electronic identification schemes (eID)**
   
If an eID is used as evidence, the CA or RA SHALL only accept “notified” eID schemes according to Article 9 of the [eIDAS Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG) and the eID shall conform to eIDAS LoA “Substantial” or “High”.

The CA SHALL document and publish information describing the eID and associated eID attributes it accepts.

4.	**From a certificate supporting a digital signature applied by the Applicant** 

If a digital signature is to be used as evidence, the CA or RA SHALL have the Applicant digitally sign the Certificate Request using a valid personal Certificate that was issued under an Approved Framework described in this section. 

Identity attributes are evidenced by the signing Certificate, not by the content of the signed document. The CA or RA SHALL only rely upon the signing Certificate as evidence for identity attributes if the digital signature is valid in accordance with the requirements of the relevant Approved Framework.

The CA SHOULD consider requirements to avoid issuance of consecutive Certificates that are issued based on a preceding Certificate, where the original verification of the Subject's identity may have been conducted in the distant past.

  a. Approved Frameworks

  * To be added by subsequent ballot.

  b. Criteria to propose additional frameworks

  The CA/Browser Forum S/MIME Certificate Working Group may consider additional trust service frameworks that provide an equivalent level of security and validation compared to these Requirements. Proposals that evaluate the additional framework against the following criteria MAY be submitted to the questions@cabforum.org mailing list:

  * Legal context: the framework SHALL be subject to regulatory provisions, which describe the requirements imposed on the Certificate issuer/trust service provider, the legal effects of the trust services, and the corresponding Certificate levels;
  * Identity validation: the approved Certificate levels must provide a level of assurance equivalent to that of the identity validation methods described in these Requirements; 
  * Supervision and auditing systems: the framework SHALL include appropriate rules providing for:
    * supervision to ensure that trust service providers meet regulatory-imposed provisions;
    * requirements imposed on auditing bodies when conducting audits; and
    * supervision of the auditing bodies.
  * Best practices and transparency: the requirements of the trust service framework and evidence of supervision of the approved trust service providers SHALL be publicly available. The trust service framework shall require trust service providers to disclose their practices in a publicly available CP and/or CPS.

5.	**From Enterprise RA records** 

In the case of `Sponsor-validated` Certificates approved by an Enterprise RA, records maintained by the Enterprise RA SHALL be accepted as evidence of Individual identity. 

The Enterprise RA SHALL maintain records to satisfy the requirements of [Section 1.3.2](#132-registration-authorities) and [Section 8.8](#88-review-of-delegated-parties).

6. **Affiliation from company attestation**

In the case of `Sponsor-validated` Certificates not approved by an Enterprise RA, the CA or RA MAY verify the authority or affiliation of an Individual to represent an Organization to be included in the `subject:organizationName` of the Certificate using an Attestation provided by the Organization and verified in accordance with [Section 3.2.8](#328-reliability-of-verification-sources). 

The CA or RA SHALL still verify the identity of the Individual in accordance with [Section 3.2.4](#324-authentication-of-individual-identity) and the Organization in accordance with [Section 3.2.3](#323-authentication-of-organization-identity).

7. **From a general attestation** 

Evidence for Individual identity attributes MAY be gathered using an Attestation from a qualified legal practitioner or notary in the Applicant's jurisdiction. 

8. **From authorized reference sources as supplementary evidence** 
   
Evidence for Individual identity attributes SHALL use at least one of the following sources for authoritative evidence:  a physical or digital identity document, digital signature supported by certificate, Enterprise RA records, or suitable Attestation.

The CA or RA MAY additionally gather and verify supplementary evidence using authorized sources such as additional official documents, government or regulatory registers, or national population registers.

Examples of this method include:

* If the Subject presents an ID featuring an Applicant name that has subsequently been changed, the evidence MAY be complemented by inspection of an official document such as a marriage certificate or court order documenting the change.
* If a professional Title of a regulated profession in the`subject:country`, or a corporate Title linked to the `subject:organizationName`, is to be used it SHALL be verified against supporting documentation, a Reliable Data Source, or Attestation.
* In cases where the "role" LEI is included in an extension of a `Sponsor-validated` Certificate, the CA SHALL verify that the LEI is assigned to the Individual and the `subject:organizationName` in the Certificate Subject.
* The CA MAY verify the address (but not the identity) of the Applicant using a utility bill, bank statement, credit card statement, government-issued tax document, or other form of identification that the CA determines to be reliable.

The CA SHALL internally document the accepted reference sources, including a description of the documents or Attestations accepted as supplementary evidence.

#### 3.2.4.2 Validation of individual identity

The CA or RA SHALL validate all identity attributes of the Individual to be included in the Certificate.

If the evidence has an explicit validity period, the CA SHALL verify that the time of the identity validation is within this validity period. In context this can include the `notBefore` and `notAfter` fields of a digital signature Certificate or the date of expiry of an identity document.

The CA or RA MAY reuse existing evidence to validate Individual identity subject to the age restrictions in [Section 4.2.1](#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions).

1.	**Validation of a physical identity document** 

The physical identity document SHALL be presented in its original form. The CA SHALL employ procedures to ensure the evidence presented by the Applicant is a genuine identity document that is not counterfeited or falsified/modified.

The CA or RA MAY use manual (in person) or remote procedures. A remote process SHALL ensure that the Applicant has the document in hand and presents the document in real-time in front of a camera.

The CA or RA registration agent SHALL make a visual comparison of the physical appearance of the Applicant and the face photo and/or other information on the physical identity document.

The CA or RA registration agent SHALL have access to authoritative sources of information on document appearance and validation for forms of identity document accepted by the CA.  

The CA or RA SHALL retain information sufficient to evidence the fulfillment of the identity validation process and the verified attributes. In addition to identity attributes, the CA or RA SHALL record the following information: issuer, validity period, and the document's unique identification number.

Automated and manual processes MAY be used in combination, (for example the CA or RA may deploy automated tools to support the work of a registration agent, or an automated process that falls back to a registration agent if the process yields an uncertain result).

2.	**Validation of a digital identity document**

The CA or RA SHALL only accept digital identity documents if the issuer's digital signature on the document is successfully validated according to ICAO 9303 part 11.

The CA or RA SHALL record information obtained from the digital identity document to evidence the identity proofing process. In addition to identity attributes and face photo, the following information SHALL be recorded: issuer, validity period, and the document's unique identification number.

The CA or RA registration agent SHALL make a visual comparison of the physical appearance of the Applicant and the face photo and/or other information on the digital identity document.

Automated and manual processes MAY be used in combination, (for example using automated tools to support the work of a registration agent, or an automated process that falls back to a registration agent if the process yields an uncertain result).

3. **Validation of eID**
   
If authentication using an eID is used as evidence, the CA or RA SHALL confirm that the eID scheme is suitable (i.e., that the eID is accessible via a "notified" eIDAS-Node), and that the individual eID is valid (i.e., not expired, suspended, or revoked).  

The authentication using the eID SHALL be created as part of the identity validation process, and evidence of the validation with the eID's Identity Provider (IdP) SHALL be retained by the CA or RA.

4.	**Validation of digital signature with certificate** 

If a digital signature with Certificate is used as evidence, the signature SHALL be created as part of the identity validation process.

The CA or RA SHALL validate the digital signature and SHALL only use the signing Certificate as evidence for identity attributes if the signature is valid.

If required identity attributes to be collected are not present in the Certificate, the CA or RA SHALL collect these attributes from other sources and validate them accordingly.

5.	**Validation of an Attestation**

If an Attestation is used as evidence for the validation of Individual identity attributes, then the reliability of the Attestation SHALL be verified according to [Section 3.2.8](#328-reliability-of-verification-sources).

6. **Validation using an Enterprise RA record**

An Enterprise RA issuing a Sponsor-validated Certificate SHALL validate all identity attributes of an Individual to be included in the Certificate. The Enterprise RA MAY rely upon existing internal records to validate Individual identity.

### 3.2.5 Non-verified subscriber information

Subscriber information that has not been verified in accordance with these Requirements SHALL NOT be included in Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates.

### 3.2.6 Validation of authority

Before commencing to issue `Organization-validated` and `Sponsor-validated` Certificates for an Applicant, the CA or RA SHALL use a Reliable Method of Communication to verify the authority and approval of an Applicant Representative to perform one or more of the following:

*  to act as an Enterprise RA;
*  to request issuance or revocation of Certificates; or 
*  to assign responsibilities to others to act in these roles. 

The CA or RA MAY establish a process that allows an Applicant to specify the individuals who may act as Applicant Representatives on an ongoing basis. The CA SHALL provide an Applicant with a list of its authorized Applicant Representatives upon the Applicant's verified written request.

The CA or RA MAY use the sources listed in [Section 3.2.3.2.1](#3231-attribute-collection-of-organization-identity) to verify the Reliable Method of Communication. Provided that the CA or RA uses a Reliable Method of Communication, the CA or RA MAY establish the authenticity of the Certificate Request directly with the Applicant Representative or with an authoritative source within the Applicant's organization, such as the Applicant's main business offices, corporate offices, human resource offices, information technology offices, or other department that the CA or RA deems appropriate. 

### 3.2.7 Criteria for interoperation

The Certificate Request SHALL contain a request from, or on behalf of, the Applicant for the issuance of a Certificate, and a certification by, or on behalf of, the Applicant that all of the information contained therein is correct.

One Certificate Request MAY suffice for multiple Certificates to be issued to the same Applicant, subject to the validation reuse periods described in [Section 4.2.1](#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions), provided that each Certificate is supported by a valid, current Certificate Request signed by the appropriate Applicant Representative on behalf of the Applicant. 

A CA may rely on a previously verified Certificate Request to issue a replacement Certificate if:

1. The previous Certificate being referenced was not revoked;
2. The expiration date of the replacement Certificate is the same as the previous Certificate being referenced; and
3. The Subject Information of the Certificate is the same as the previous Certificate being referenced.

## 4.2 Certificate application processing

### 4.2.1 Performing identification and authentication functions

Applicant information SHALL include, but not be limited to, at least one Mailbox Field to be included in the Certificate's `subjectAltName` extension.

[Section 6.3.2](#632-certificate-operational-periods-and-key-pair-usage-periods) limits the validity period of Subscriber Certificates. 

The CA MAY reuse completed validations and/or supporting evidence performed in accordance with [Section 3.2](#32-initial-identity-validation) within the following limits:

1. **Validation of mailbox authorization or control**: Completed validation of the control of a mail server in accordance with [Section 3.2.2.1](#3221-validating-authority-over-mailbox-via-domain) or [Section 3.2.2.3](#3223-validating-applicant-as-operator-of-associated-mail-servers) SHALL be obtained no more than 398 days prior to issuing the Certificate. 
   
      In the event of changes to the TLS Baseline Requirements methods specified in [Section 3.2.2.1](#3221-validating-authority-over-mailbox-via-domain), a CA MAY continue to reuse completed validations and/or supporting evidence for the period stated in this section.

      Completed validation of control of a mailbox in accordance with [Section 3.2.2.2](#3222-validating-control-over-mailbox-via-email) SHALL be obtained no more than 30 days prior to issuing the Certificate.

2. **Authentication of organization identity**: Completed validation of organization identity in accordance with [Section 3.2.3](#323-authentication-of-organization-identity) SHALL be obtained no more than 825 days prior to issuing the Certificate. 
 
      Validation of authority in accordance with [Section 3.2.6](#326-validation-of-authority) SHALL be obtained no more than 825 days prior to issuing the Certificate, unless a contract between the CA and the Applicant specifies a different term. For example, the contract MAY include the perpetual assignment of roles until revoked by the Applicant or CA, or until the contract expires or is terminated.

3. **Authentication of individual identity**: Completed validation of Individual identity in accordance with [Section 3.2.4](#324-authentication-of-individual-identity) SHALL be obtained no more than 825 days prior to issuing the Certificate. 

A prior validation SHALL NOT be reused if any data or document used in the prior validation was obtained more than the maximum time permitted for reuse of the data or document prior to issuing the Certificate.

### 4.2.2 Approval or rejection of certificate applications

#### 4.2.2.1 Certification authority authorization

Starting on September 15, 2024 prior to issuing a Certificate that includes a Mailbox Address, the CA SHOULD retrieve and process CAA records in accordance with Section 4 of [RFC 9495: Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Processing for Email Addresses](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9495.html).

Starting on March 15, 2025 prior to issuing a Certificate that includes a Mailbox Address, the CA SHALL retrieve and process CAA records in accordance with Section 4 of [RFC 9495: Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Processing for Email Addresses](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9495.html).

When processing CAA records, CAs SHALL process the `issuemail` property tag as specified in RFC 9495. Additional property tags MAY be supported, but SHALL NOT conflict with or supersede the authorizations to issue S/MIME Certificates as specified in the `issuemail` property tag. 

If the CA issues a Certificate following a CAA check, they SHALL do so within the TTL of the CAA record, or 8 hours, whichever is greater. This stipulation does not prevent the CA from checking CAA records at any other time.

If the Certificate includes more than one Mailbox Address, then the CA SHALL perform the above procedure for each Mailbox Address. 

CAA checking is optional for Certificates issued by a Technically Constrained Subordinate CA Certificate as set out in [Section 7.1.5](#715-name-constraints), where the lack of CAA checking is an explicit contractual provision in the contract with the Technically Constrained Subordinate CA Applicant.

The CA SHALL NOT issue a Certificate unless the CA determines that Certificate Request is consistent with the applicable CAA RRset. The CA SHALL log all actions taken, if any, consistent with its CAA processing practice.

CAs are permitted to treat a record lookup failure as permission to issue if:

* the failure is outside the CA's infrastructure; and
* the lookup has been retried at least once; and
* the domain's zone does not have a DNSSEC validation chain to the ICANN root.

### 4.2.3 Time to process certificate applications

9. Revocation is required by the Issuing CA's CP and/or CPS.

### 4.9.2 Who can request revocation

The Subscriber, RA, or Issuing CA can initiate revocation. Additionally, Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties MAY submit Certificate Problem Reports informing the Issuing CA of reasonable cause to revoke a Certificate.

### 4.9.3 Procedure for revocation request

The CA SHALL provide a process for Subscribers to request revocation of their own Certificates. The process SHALL be described in the CA's CP and/or CPS. The CA SHALL maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to accept and respond to revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports.

The CA SHALL provide clear instructions for reporting suspected Private Key Compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA SHALL publicly disclose the instructions through a readily accessible online means and in Section 1.5.2 of their CPS.

### 4.9.4 Revocation request grace period

No stipulation.

### 4.9.5 Time within which CA must process the revocation request

Within 24 hours after receiving a Certificate Problem Report, the CA SHALL investigate the facts and circumstances related to a Certificate Problem Report and provide a preliminary report on its findings to both the Subscriber and the entity who filed the Certificate Problem Report.

After reviewing the facts and circumstances, the CA SHALL work with the Subscriber and any entity reporting the Certificate Problem Report or other revocation-related notice to establish whether or not the Certificate will be revoked, and if so, a date on which the CA will revoke the Certificate. The period from receipt of the Certificate Problem Report or revocation-related notice to published revocation SHALL NOT exceed the time frame set forth in [Section 4.9.1.1](#4911-reasons-for-revoking-a-subscriber-certificate). The date selected by the CA SHOULD consider the following criteria:

2. The consequences of revocation (direct and collateral impacts to Subscribers and Relying Parties);
3. The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;
4. The entity making the complaint (for example, a complaint from a law enforcement official should be addressed with higher priority); and
5. Relevant legislation.
   
### 4.9.6 Revocation checking requirement for relying parties

No stipulation. 

**Note**: Following Certificate issuance, a Certificate may be revoked for reasons stated in [Section 4.9](#49-certificate-revocation-and-suspension). Therefore, Relying Parties SHOULD check the revocation status of all Certificates that contain a CDP or OCSP pointer.

### 4.9.7 CRL issuance frequency

For the status of Subscriber Certificates: the CA SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least once every seven days, and the value of the `nextUpdate` field SHALL NOT be more than ten days beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates: the CA SHALL update and reissue CRLs at least:

1. once every twelve months; and
2. within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.

The value of the `nextUpdate` field SHALL NOT be more than twelve months beyond the value of the `thisUpdate` field.

1. Be signed by the CA that issued the Certificates whose revocation status is being checked, or
2. Be signed by an OCSP Responder whose Certificate is signed by the CA that issued the Certificate whose revocation status is being checked.
   
In the latter case, the OCSP signing Certificate SHALL contain the ocspSigning EKU (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) and an extension of type `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck`, as defined by [RFC 6960](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960).

### 4.9.10 On-line revocation checking requirements

OCSP responders operated by the CA SHALL support the HTTP GET method, as described in [RFC 6960](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960) and/or [RFC 5019](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5019).

The validity interval of an OCSP response is the difference in time between the thisUpdate and nextUpdate field, inclusive. For purposes of computing differences, a difference of 3,600 seconds SHALL be equal to one hour, and a difference of 86,400 seconds SHALL be equal to one day, ignoring leap-seconds.

For the status of Subscriber Certificates:

1. OCSP responses SHALL have a validity interval greater than or equal to eight hours;
2. OCSP responses SHALL have a validity interval less than or equal to ten days;
3. For OCSP responses with validity intervals less than sixteen hours, then the CA SHALL update the information provided via an Online Certificate Status Protocol prior to one-half of the validity period before the nextUpdate; and
4. For OCSP responses with validity intervals greater than or equal to sixteen hours, then the CA SHALL update the information provided via an Online Certificate Status Protocol at least eight hours prior to the nextUpdate, and no later than four days after the thisUpdate.
   
For the status of Subordinate CA Certificates, the CA SHALL update information provided via OCSP:

1. at least every twelve months; and
2. within 24 hours after revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate.

If the OCSP responder receives a request for the status of a Certificate serial number that is "unused", then the responder SHOULD NOT respond with a "good" status. If the OCSP responder is for a CA that is not Technically Constrained in line with [Section 7.1.5](#715-name-constraints), the responder SHALL NOT respond with a "good" status for such requests.

A Certificate serial number within an OCSP request is "assigned" if a Certificate with that serial number has been issued by the Issuing CA, using any current or previous key associated with that CA subject, or "unused" if otherwise.

For CA Key Pairs that are either

1. used as a CA Key Pair for a Root CA Certificate; or
2. used as a CA Key Pair for a Subordinate CA Certificate, where the Subordinate CA is not the operator of the Root CA or an Affiliate of the Root CA,

the CA SHALL:

1. prepare and follow a Key Generation Script;
2. have a Qualified Auditor witness the CA Key Pair generation process or record a video of the entire CA Key Pair generation process; and
3. have a Qualified Auditor issue a report opining that the CA followed its key ceremony during its Key and Certificate generation process and the controls used to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the Key Pair.

For other CA Key Pairs that are for the operator of the Root CA or an Affiliate of the Root CA, the CA SHOULD:

1. prepare and follow a Key Generation Script; and
2. either (i) have a Qualified Auditor witness the CA Key Pair generation process, or (ii) video-record the entire CA Key Pair generation process for review by its Qualified Auditor.

In all cases, the CA SHALL:

1. generate the CA Key Pair in a physically secured environment as described in the CA's CP and/or CPS;
2. generate the CA Key Pair using personnel in Trusted Roles under the principles of multiple person control and split knowledge;
3. generate the CA Key Pair within cryptographic modules meeting the applicable technical and business requirements as disclosed in the CA's CP and/or CPS;
4. log its CA Key Pair generation activities; and

2. There is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed;
3. The CA is aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Applicant's Private Key to compromise;
4. The CA has previously been made aware that the Applicant's Private Key has suffered a Key Compromise, such as through the provisions of [Section 4.9.1.1](#4911-reasons-for-revoking-a-subscriber-certificate);
5. The CA is aware of a demonstrated or proven method to easily compute the Applicant's Private Key based on the Public Key (such as a Debian weak key, see <https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys>).

The CA or a Delegated Third Party MAY generate the Private Key on behalf of the Subscriber.

### 6.1.2 Private key delivery to subscriber

Parties other than the Subscriber SHALL NOT archive the Subscriber Private Key without authorization by the Subscriber.

If the CA or any of its designated RAs become aware that a Subscriber's Private Key has been communicated to a person or organization not authorized by the Subscriber, then the CA SHALL revoke all Certificates that include the Public Key corresponding to the communicated Private Key.

If the CA or a Delegated Third Party generates the Private Key on behalf of the Subscriber where the Private Keys will be transported to the Subscriber, then the entity generating the Private Key SHALL either:

1. Transport the Private Key in hardware with an activation method that is equivalent to 128 bits of encryption, where the material used to activate/protect the Private Key (e.g., a password used to secure a PKCS 12 file) must be delivered to the Subscriber securely and separately from the container holding the Private Key; or 
2. Encrypt the Private Key with at least 112 bits of encryption strength. 
   
Illustrative examples include:

* Using a 128-bit AES key to wrap the Private Key.
* Storing the key in a PKCS 12 file encrypted using a password and algorithm whose combination provides at least 112 bits of encryption strength.
* Transporting the Private Key and/or PKCS 12 file and/or activation material via a TLS or other authenticated and encrypted network connection with at least 112 bits of encryption strength.

d. __Certificate Field:__ `subject:organizationIdentifier` (2.5.4.97)  
   __Contents:__ If present, the `subject:organizationIdentifier` field SHALL contain a Registration Reference for a Legal Entity assigned in accordance to the identified Registration Scheme. 

   The `subject:organizationIdentifier` SHALL be encoded as a PrintableString or UTF8String.

   The Registration Scheme identified in the Certificate SHALL be the result of the verification performed in accordance with [Section 3.2.3](#323-authentication-of-organization-identity). The Registration Scheme SHALL be identified using the following structure in the presented order:

    * 3 character Registration Scheme identifier;
    * 2 character ISO 3166-1 country code for the nation in which the Registration Scheme is operated, or if the scheme is operated globally (such as LEI) then the ISO 3166-1 code "XG" SHALL be used;
    * For the NTR Registration Scheme identifier, where registrations are administrated at the subdivision (state or province) level, a plus "+" (0x2B (ASCII), U+002B (UTF-8)) followed by an up-to-three alphanumeric character ISO 3166-2 identifier for the subdivision of the nation in which the Registration Scheme is operated;
    * a hyphen-minus "-" (0x2D (ASCII), U+002D (UTF-8));
    * Registration Reference allocated in accordance with the identified Registration Scheme.

   **Note 1**: Registration References MAY contain hyphens but Registration Schemes, ISO 3166-1 country codes, and ISO 3166-2 identifiers do not. Therefore if more than one hyphen appears in the structure, the leftmost hyphen is a separator, and the remaining hyphens are part of the Registration Reference. For example:

    * `NTRGB-12345678` (NTR scheme, Great Britain, Unique Identifier at Country level is 12345678).
    * `NTRUS+CA-12345678` (NTR Scheme, United States - California, Unique identifier at State level is 12345678).
    * `VATDE-123456789` (VAT Scheme, Germany, Unique Identifier at Country Level is 12345678).
    * `PSDBE-NBB-1234.567.890` (PSD Scheme, Belgium, NCA's identifier is NBB, Unique Identifier assigned by the NCA is 1234.567.890).

   Registration Schemes listed in [Appendix A](#appendix-a---registration-schemes) are recognized as valid under these Requirements. The CA SHALL:

   1. Confirm that the organization represented by the Registration Reference is the same as the organization named in the `organizationName` field as specified in [Section 7.1.4.2.2](#71422-subject-distinguished-name-fields); and
   2. Further verify the Registration Reference matches other information verified in accordance with [Section 3.2.3](#323-authentication-of-organization-identity).

   **Note 2**: For the following types of entities that do not have an identifier from the Registration Schemes listed in [Appendix A](#appendix-a---registration-schemes):

    * For Government Entities, the CA SHALL enter the Registration Scheme identifier ‘GOV’ followed by the 2 character ISO 3166-1 country code for the nation in which the Government Entity is located.  If the Government Entity is verified at a subdivision (state or province) level, then a plus "+" (0x2B (ASCII), U+002B (UTF-8)) followed by an ISO 3166-2 identifier for the subdivision (up to three alphanumeric characters) is added.
    * For International Organization Entities, the CA SHALL enter the Registration Scheme identifier ‘INT’ followed by the ISO 3166-1 code "XG". An International Organization Entity is founded by a constituent document, e.g., a charter, treaty, convention or similar document, signed by, or on behalf of, a minimum of two Sovereign State governments.
  
    For example:
    * GOVUS (Government Entity, United States)
    * GOVUS+CA (Government Entity, United States - California)
    * INTXG (International Organization)

If the Subordinate CA Certificate includes the `id-kp-emailProtection` extended key usage, then for the Subordinate CA Certificate to be considered Technically Constrained it SHALL include the `nameConstraints` X.509v3 extension with constraints on `rfc822Name` and `directoryName` as follows:

   1. For each `rfc822Name` in `permittedSubtrees`, each `rfc822Name` SHALL contain either a FQDN or a U+002E FULL STOP (".") character followed by a FQDN. The `rfc822Name` SHALL NOT contain an email address. The CA SHALL confirm that the Applicant has registered the FQDN contained in the `rfc822Name` or has been authorized by the domain registrant to act on the registrant's behalf in line with the verification practices of [Section 3.2.2.3](#3223-validating-applicant-as-operator-of-associated-mail-servers).

   2. For each `directoryName` in `permittedSubtrees`, the CA SHALL confirm the Applicant's and/or Subsidiary's Organizational name and location such that end entity Certificates issued from the Subordinate CA Certificate will be in compliance with [Section 7.1.2.4](#7124-all-certificates).

### 7.1.6 Certificate policy object identifier

This section describes the content requirements for the Root CA, Subordinate CA, and Subscriber Certificates as they relate to the identification of Certificate Policy.

#### 7.1.6.1 Reserved certificate policy identifiers

# 8. COMPLIANCE AUDIT AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS

The CA SHALL at all times:

1. Issue Certificates and operate its PKI in accordance with all law applicable to its business and the Certificates it issues in every jurisdiction in which it operates;
2. Comply with these Requirements;
3. Comply with the audit requirements set forth in this section; and
4. Be licensed as a CA in each jurisdiction where it operates, if licensing is required by the law of such jurisdiction for the issuance of Certificates.

**Note**: The CA/Browser Forum continues to improve the S/MIME Baseline Requirements while CPA Canada/WebTrust and ETSI also continue to update their audit criteria. We encourage all CAs to conform to each revision herein on the date specified without awaiting a corresponding update to an applicable audit criterion. In the event of a conflict between an existing audit criterion and a revision to the S/MIME Baseline Requirements, we will communicate with the audit community and attempt to resolve any uncertainty, and we will respond to implementation questions directed to <questions@cabforum.org>. 

## 8.1 Frequency or circumstances of assessment

Certificates that are capable of being used to issue new Certificates SHALL either be Technically Constrained in line with [Section 7.1.5](#715-name-constraints) and audited in line with [Section 8.8](#88-review-of-delegated-parties) only, or unconstrained and fully audited in line with all remaining requirements from this section. A Certificate is deemed as capable of being used to issue new Certificates if it contains an X.509v3 `basicConstraints` extension, with the `cA` boolean set to true and is therefore by definition a Root CA Certificate or a Subordinate CA Certificate.

The period during which the CA issues Certificates SHALL be divided into an unbroken sequence of audit periods. An audit period SHALL NOT exceed one year in duration.

If the CA has a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with an audit scheme listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then no pre-issuance readiness assessment is necessary.

If the CA does not have a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), then, before issuing Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates, the CA SHALL successfully complete a point-in-time readiness assessment performed in accordance with applicable standards under one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment). The point-in-time readiness assessment SHALL be completed no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificates and SHALL be followed by a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first Publicly-Trusted S/MIME Certificate.

## 8.2 Identity/qualifications of assessor

The CA's audit SHALL be performed by a Qualified Auditor. A Qualified Auditor means a Natural Person, Legal Entity, or group of Natural Persons or Legal Entities that collectively possess the following qualifications and skills:

1. Independence from the subject of the audit;
2. The ability to conduct an audit that addresses the criteria specified in an Eligible Audit Scheme (see [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment));
3. Employs individuals who have proficiency in examining Public Key Infrastructure technology, information security tools and techniques, information technology and security auditing, and the third-party attestation function;
4. (For audits conducted in accordance with any one of the ETSI standards) accredited in accordance with ISO 17065 applying the requirements specified in ETSI EN 319 403 or ETSI EN 319 403-1;
5. (For audits conducted in accordance with the WebTrust standard) licensed for WebTrust by CPA Canada;
6. Bound by law, government regulation, or professional code of ethics; and
7. Except in the case of an Internal Government Auditing Agency, maintains Professional Liability/Errors & Omissions insurance with policy limits of at least one million US dollars in coverage.
   
## 8.3 Assessor's relationship to assessed entity

No stipulation.

## 8.4 Topics covered by assessment

The CA SHALL undergo an audit in accordance with one of the following schemes:

1. For Audit Periods starting before the Effective Date defined in [Section 1.2.1](#121-revisions) of the first version of these Requirements, “WebTrust for CAs v2.2.2 or newer”; or
2. For Audit Periods starting after the Effective Date defined in [Section 1.2.1](#121-revisions) of the first version of these Requirements, “WebTrust for CAs v2.2.2 or newer” AND “WebTrust for S/MIME Baseline Requirements v1.0.0 or newer”; or
3. ETSI TS 119 411-6 v1.1.1 or newer, which includes normative references to ETSI EN 319 401, ETSI EN 319 411-1 and ETSI EN 319 411-2 (the latest version of the referenced ETSI documents should be applied); or
4. If a Government CA is required by its Certificate Policy to use a different internal audit scheme, it MAY use such scheme provided that the audit either
   a. encompasses all requirements of one of the above schemes; or
   b. consists of comparable criteria that are available for public review.
Whichever scheme is chosen, it SHALL incorporate periodic monitoring and/or accountability procedures to ensure that its audits continue to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the scheme.

The audit SHALL be conducted by a Qualified Auditor, as specified in [Section 8.2](#82-identityqualifications-of-assessor).

For Delegated Third Parties that are not Enterprise RAs, then the CA SHALL obtain an audit report, issued under the auditing standards that underlie the accepted audit schemes found above in this [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), that provides an opinion whether the Delegated Third Party's performance complies with either the Delegated Third Party's practice statement or the CA's CP and/or CPS as described in [Section 1.3.2](#132-registration-authorities). If the opinion is that the Delegated Third Party does not comply, then the CA SHALL not allow the Delegated Third Party to continue performing delegated functions.

The audit period for the Delegated Third Party SHALL NOT exceed one year (ideally aligned with the CA's audit). 

## 8.5 Actions taken as a result of deficiency

No stipulation.

## 8.6 Communication of results

The Audit Report SHALL state explicitly that it covers the relevant systems and processes used in the issuance of all Certificates that assert one or more of the policy identifiers listed in [Section 7.1.6.1](#7161-reserved-certificate-policy-identifiers). The CA SHALL make the Audit Report publicly available.

The CA SHALL make its Audit Report publicly available no later than three months after the end of the audit period. In the event of a delay greater than three months, the CA SHALL provide an explanatory letter signed by the Qualified Auditor.

The Audit Report SHALL contain at least the following clearly-labelled information:

1. Name of the organization being audited;
2. Name and address of the organization performing the audit;
3. The SHA-256 fingerprint of all Roots and Subordinate CA Certificates, including Cross Certificates, that were in-scope of the audit;
4. Audit criteria, with version number(s), that were used to audit each of the Certificates (and associated keys);
5. A list of the CA policy documents, with version numbers, referenced during the audit;
6. Whether the audit assessed a period of time or a point in time;
7. The start date and end date of the Audit Period, for those that cover a period of time;
8. The point in time date, for those that are for a point in time;
9. The date the report was issued, which will necessarily be after the end date or point in time date; 
10. (For audits conducted in accordance with any of the ETSI standards) a statement to indicate if the audit was a full audit or a surveillance audit, and which portions of the criteria were applied and evaluated, e.g., ETSI EN 319 401, ETSI TS 119 411-6, ETSI EN 319 411-1 policy LCP, NCP or NCP+, ETSI EN 319 411-2 policy QCP-n, QCP-n-qscd, QCP-l or QCP-l-qscd; and
11. (For audits conducted in accordance with any of the ETSI standards) a statement to indicate that the auditor referenced the applicable CA/Browser Forum criteria, such as this document, and the version used.

An authoritative English language version of the publicly available audit information SHALL be provided by the Qualified Auditor and the CA SHALL ensure that it is publicly available.

The Audit Report SHALL be available as a PDF, and SHALL be text searchable for all information required. Each SHA-256 fingerprint within the Audit Report SHALL be uppercase letters and SHALL NOT contain colons, spaces, or line feeds. See https://www.ccadb.org/policy#51-audit-statement-content for more information.

## 8.7 Self audits

During the period in which the CA issues Certificates, the CA SHALL monitor adherence to its CP and/or CPS and these Requirements and control its service quality by performing self audits on at least a quarterly basis against a randomly selected sample including a minimum of the greater of thirty (30) Certificates or three percent (3%) of the Certificates issued by it during the period commencing immediately after the previous self-audit sample was taken. 

## 8.8 Review of delegated parties 

Except for Delegated Third Parties, Enterprise RAs, and Technically Constrained Subordinate CAs that undergo an annual audit that meets the criteria specified in [Section 8.4](#84-topics-covered-by-assessment), the CA SHALL ensure the practices and procedures of delegated parties are in compliance with these Requirements and the relevant CP and/or CPS. The CA shall document the obligations of delegated parties and perform monitoring on at least an annual basis of the delegated parties' adherence with those obligations.

## 9.6 Representations and warranties

### 9.6.1 CA representations and warranties

By issuing a Certificate, the CA makes the warranties listed herein to the following Certificate Beneficiaries:

1. The Subscriber that is a party to the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use for the Certificate;
2. All Application Software Suppliers with whom the Root CA has entered into a contract for inclusion of its Root CA Certificate in software distributed by such Application Software Supplier; and
3. All Relying Parties who reasonably rely on a Valid Certificate. 

The CA represents and warrants to the Certificate Beneficiaries that, during the period when the Certificate is valid, the CA has complied with these Requirements and its CP and/or CPS in issuing and managing the Certificate.

The Certificate Warranties specifically include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. **Right to Use Mailbox Address**: That, at the time of issuance, the CA:<br>
   i. implemented a procedure for verifying that the Applicant either had the right to use, or had control of, the Mailbox Addresses listed in the Certificate's `subject` field and `subjectAltName` extension (or was delegated such right or control by someone who had such right to use or control);
   ii. followed the procedure when issuing the Certificate; and
   iii. accurately described the procedure in the CA's CP and/or CPS;
2. **Authorization for Certificate**: That, at the time of issuance, the CA:<br>
   i. implemented a procedure for verifying that the Subject authorized the issuance of the Certificate and that the Applicant Representative is authorized to request the Certificate on behalf of the Subject;
   ii. followed the procedure when issuing the Certificate; and
   iii. accurately described the procedure in the CA's CP and/or CPS;

### 9.6.2 RA representations and warranties

No stipulation.

### 9.6.3 Subscriber representations and warranties

The CA SHALL require, as part of the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use, that the Applicant make the commitments and warranties in this section for the benefit of the CA and the Certificate Beneficiaries.

Prior to the issuance of a Certificate, the CA SHALL obtain, for the express benefit of the CA and the Certificate Beneficiaries, either the Applicant's:

1. Agreement to the Subscriber Agreement with the CA; or
2. Acknowledgement of the Terms of Use.

The CA SHALL implement a process to ensure that each Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use is legally enforceable against the Applicant. In either case, the Agreement SHALL apply to the Certificate to be issued pursuant to the Certificate Request. The CA MAY use an electronic or "click-through" Agreement provided that the CA has determined that such agreements are legally enforceable. A separate Agreement MAY be used for each Certificate Request, or a single Agreement MAY be used to cover multiple future Certificate Requests and the resulting Certificates, so long as each Certificate that the CA issues to the Applicant is clearly covered by that Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use.

The Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use SHALL contain provisions imposing on the Applicant itself (or made by the Applicant on behalf of its principal or agent under a subcontractor or hosting service relationship) the following obligations and warranties:

1. **Accuracy of Information**: An obligation and warranty to provide accurate and complete information at all times to the CA, both in the Certificate Request and as otherwise requested by the CA in connection with the issuance of the Certificate(s) to be supplied by the CA;
2. **Protection of Private Key**: An obligation and warranty by the Applicant to take all reasonable measures to assure control of, keep confidential, and properly protect at all times the Private Key that corresponds to the Public Key to be included in the requested Certificate(s) (and any associated activation data or device such as a password or token);
3. **Acceptance of Certificate**: An obligation and warranty that the Subscriber will review and verify the Certificate contents for accuracy;
4. **Use of Certificate**: An obligation and warranty to use the Certificate only on MailBox Addresses listed in the Certificate, and to use the Certificate solely in compliance with all applicable laws and solely in accordance with the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use;

   ii. promptly request revocation of the Certificate, and cease using it, if any information in the Certificate is or becomes incorrect or inaccurate;
6. **Termination of Use of Certificate**: An obligation and warranty to promptly cease all use of the Private Key corresponding to the Public Key included in the Certificate upon revocation of that Certificate for reasons of Key Compromise.
7. **Responsiveness**: An obligation to respond to the CA's instructions concerning Key Compromise or Certificate misuse within a specified time period.
8. **Acknowledgment and Acceptance**: An acknowledgment and acceptance that the CA is entitled to revoke the Certificate immediately if the Applicant were to violate the terms of the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use, or if revocation is required by the CA's CP and/or CPS, or by these Requirements.


### 9.6.4 Relying party representations and warranties

No stipulation.

### 9.6.5 Representations and warranties of other participants

No stipulation.

## 9.7 Disclaimers of warranties

No stipulation.

## 9.8 Limitations of liability

For delegated tasks, the CA and any Delegated Third Party MAY allocate liability between themselves contractually as they determine, but the CA SHALL remain fully responsible for the performance of all parties in accordance with these Requirements, as if the tasks had not been delegated.

If the CA has issued and managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its CP and/or CPS, the CA MAY disclaim liability to the Certificate Beneficiaries or any other third parties for any losses suffered as a result of use or reliance on such Certificate beyond those specified in the CA's CP and/or CPS. If the CA has not issued or managed the Certificate in compliance with these Requirements and its CP and/or CPS, the CA MAY seek to limit its liability to the Subscriber and to Relying Parties, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved, for any and all claims, losses or damages suffered as a result of the use or reliance on such Certificate by any appropriate means that the CA desires. If the CA chooses to limit its liability for Certificates that are not issued or managed in compliance with these Requirements or its CP and/or CPS, then the CA SHALL include the limitations on liability in the CA's CP and/or CPS.

## 9.9 Indemnities

Notwithstanding any limitations on its liability to Subscribers and Relying Parties, the CA understands and acknowledges that the Application Software Suppliers who have agreed to distribute the Root CA Certificate do not assume any obligation or potential liability of the CA under these Requirements or that otherwise might exist because of the issuance or maintenance of Certificates or reliance thereon by Relying Parties or others. Thus, except in the case where the CA is a government entity, the CA SHALL defend, indemnify, and hold harmless each Application Software Supplier for any and all claims, damages, and losses suffered by such Application Software Supplier related to a Certificate issued by the CA, regardless of the cause of action or legal theory involved.

This applies only to operations or Certificate issuances that are subject to that Law.

The CA SHALL also (prior to issuing a Certificate under the modified requirement) notify the CA/Browser Forum of the relevant information newly added to its CPS by sending a message to <public@cabforum.org> and receiving confirmation that it has been posted to the Public Mailing List and is indexed in the Public Mail Archives available at [https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/](https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/) (or such other email addresses and links as the Forum may designate), so that the CA/Browser Forum may consider possible revisions to these Requirements accordingly.

Any modification to CA practice enabled under this section SHALL be discontinued if and when the Law no longer applies, or these Requirements are modified to make it possible to comply with both them and the Law simultaneously.

# Appendix B - Transition of Extant S/MIME CAs

Following the Effective Date for v 1.0.0 of these Requirements (September 1, 2023) an Extant S/MIME CA MAY continue to issue end entity S/MIME Certificates that are compliant with these Requirements. 

On or after September 15, 2024, all newly-issued Publicly-Trusted end entity S/MIME Certificates SHALL be issued from S/MIME Subordinate CAs that are compliant with these Requirements.

For backwards compatibility, Extant S/MIME CA Certificates that share the same Public Keys with S/MIME Subordinate CAs that are compliant with these Requirements, or are no longer used for signing end entity S/MIME Certificates, are not required to be revoked.
